# 2.2.3 Cycle 3: Retrieving the Analysis Data

## Design

In the last cycle we used EOD to retrieve stock and exchange information for the Front-end. In this Cycle I want to get together the data I need to do the linear regression analysis.

This will involve the following EOD API's.

* End of Day API. Allowing me to get Volume, End of Day Price&#x20;
* Insider Transactions API. Giving us purchases and sales of the officers in the stock.
* Fundamental Data API to get Earning History.
* Sentiment Data (Financial News) API.&#x20;

The aim will be to produce a daily list containing the following fields:

* Date
* Season
* EOD Price
* Volume
* NewStories
* Sentiment
* Insider Sales (Just the number)
* Insider Purchases&#x20;
