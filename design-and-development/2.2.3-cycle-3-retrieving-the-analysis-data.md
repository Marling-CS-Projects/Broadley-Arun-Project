# 2.2.3 Cycle 3: Retrieving the Analysis Data

## Design

In the last cycle we used EOD to retrieve stock and exchange information for the Front-end. In this Cycle I want to get together the data I need to do the linear regression analysis.

This will involve the following EOD API's.

* End of Day API. Allowing me to get Volume, End of Day Price&#x20;
* Insider Transactions API. Giving us purchases and sales of the officers in the stock.
* Fundamental Data API to get Earning History.
* Sentiment Data (Financial News) API.&#x20;

The aim will be to produce a daily list containing the following fields:

* Date
* Season
* EOD Price
* Volume
* NewsStories
* Sentiment
* Insider Sales (Just the number)
* Insider Purchases&#x20;

As with Cycle 2 I will do the API work in the frontend. This will then need to be converted to work in the BackEnd when we have that up and running.

### Objectives



* [x] Implement the 4 required API's
* [x] Bring data into one array.
* [x] Use Data on History Screen.

### Outcomes

#### Implement the 4 required EOD API's

The historical data I need for the analysis cycle is split up in 4 different API's

* End of Day API

This  returns the history of the end of day price for a stock.&#x20;

API URL to return Apple's stolck price Looks like : [https://eodhistoricaldata.com/api/eod/AAPL.US?api\_token=64da251199fa75.51782811\&fmt=json](https://eodhistoricaldata.com/api/eod/AAPL.US?api\_token=64da251199fa75.51782811\&fmt=json)

Returned output in JSPN Looks like this.

* Insider Data

To get the history of Insider data I need to call the separate API to return the history of those transactions. I

{% embed url="https://eodhistoricaldata.com/api/insider-transactions/?api_token=64da251199fa75.51782811&fmt=json&code=AAPL.US" %}
URL Call used to retrieve Insider Dealing history
{% endembed %}

* Sentiment Data

The last data set of data that I need from EOD is the sentiment data, this will provide me with a history of news articles and sentiment of those news articles for a stock.for a specific stock. This&#x20;

To get the history I call the EOD Sentiment API with the requested stock code.

[https://eodhistoricaldata.com/api/sentiments?s=AAPL.US\&from=2009-03-14\&to=2023-08-26\&api\_token=64da251199fa75.51782811\&fmt=json](https://eodhistoricaldata.com/api/sentiments?s=AAPL.US\&from=2009-03-14\&to=2023-08-26\&api\_token=64da251199fa75.51782811\&fmt=json)

### Combine downloaded data

Now that we have retrieved all the data into three separate JSON arrays we need to combine them into one that we can do analysis on.

To do it I created an object called StockHistory and used it as the record structure for an array one for each date.

I then wrote some Javascript code that would update the array from each of the downloaded datasets.

### Use the Data on the History Component

Once I had compiled the data I then updated my history component to display the data.

This involved implementing a Table component to view the data, and setting up the HTML and the component to describe what it should view.

## Challenges

Working with the API's was difficult. They require the API call to be in a very specific format. if its wrong or incorrect it always give back the error 'Unknown Error'. The only way to really work out the detail of the error is to copy the URL into a browser. That would give you a little more information.

Merging the data between the three different datasets was also a little challenging.

## Testing



### Tests

<table><thead><tr><th width="85">Tests</th><th>Instructions</th><th>What I expect</th><th>What actually happens</th><th>Pass/Fail</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Test front end retrieval of data with : London, Lloyds  and USA, Apple</td><td>To see history for each selected stock</td><td>Worked</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Retrieve data for LLoyds, London and then check data on the 1st of August to see of correct</td><td>See if stock price is 42.8 (Got from Yahoo Finance)</td><td>stock price was 42.8</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Once London exchange selected. Type 'LLoyds' into stock selection box</td><td>I expect to see the stock tickers containing LLoyds in there name.</td><td>Front end shows 3 entries all with LLoyds in there title.</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Search US, Apple then check news story count and sentiment for 10th August 2023</td><td>I can't check underlying data but check against direct API call: should see 14 Stories and 0.84 for sentiment</td><td>I saw 14 stories and 0.84 for sensitivity</td><td>Pass</td></tr></tbody></table>
