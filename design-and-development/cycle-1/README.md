# 2.2.1 Cycle 1

## Design



in this project I have chosen to utilize angular JS which is an online, open-source library used for JavaScript framework that is easy to learn and has many unique features. angular JS allows me to increase the functionalities of HTML, enabling the creation of interactive web applications rather than just static sites.

The primary objective of this project is to use angular JS with linear regression and AI tools to predict stock market trends. By using AI I aim to develop a working system able to  forecast stock market movements with some sort of degree of accuracy.

To begin this cycle, I have focused on setting up the initial components of the user interface. Through Angular JS, I can create a draft version of the final product, allowing users to input relevant data and view the predicted stock market trends.

One of the main aspects of this project involves implementing linear regression, a  modeling technique that aims to establish a relationship between  two different variables/parameters, these being an independent variable and a dependent variable. I will utilize historical stock market data as the independent variable and attempt to predict future stock prices as the dependent variable.

Angular JS provides a framework to use AI tools and libraries essential for implementing the linear regression algorithm. By using machine learning I can train and perfect the model using historical stock market data. This enables the system to learn patterns, trends, and correlations that can possibly contribute to accurate predictions.

The user interface that will be created using Angular JS will enable users to input specific stock market data, such as historical prices, volume, and other relevant parameters. The system will then use the  linear regression model to generate predictions based on the provided historical data. The predicted stock market trends will be shown on a simple graph.

Throughout the development cycle, I will continuously test and improve the system to make its accuracy better and more usable. I will try to explore more advanced AI techniques, such as using more features like sentiment analysis of news articles or utilizing deep learning algorithms for more complex pattern recognition leading to more accurate predictions.

In conclusion, by leveraging the capabilities of Angular JS and combining them with linear regression and AI tools, this project aims to develop a powerful stock market prediction system. The intuitive user interface will provide users with the ability to input relevant data and obtain accurate forecasts of stock market trends. With further iterations and enhancements, this system has the potential to become a valuable tool for investors and financial professionals seeking insights into the stock market's future movements.
