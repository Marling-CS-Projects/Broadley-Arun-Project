# 2.2.2 Cycle 2

## Design

1. Firstly i need to gather historical stock market data for the stocks I would like to be able to predict. I can obtain this data from financial data providers like fool.co.uk or yahoo finance. From these websites i must take key data that is important like stock prices, trading volumes and other important parameters.
2. After collecting this data i must look through it. I must remove any inconsistent values or anomalies as the AI would see this data and change its prediction methods due to anomalous results leading to less accurate predictions a large majority of the time. I must also split the data into data i will use to train the AI and data i will use to test the AI. A typical split would be around 80% train data and 20% test data.
3. After splitting the data into test and training data i will have to choose a suitable AI model. Usually for stock price predictions linear regression, support vector machines or decision trees are used and i will be using a linear regression method.
4. After choosing a linear regression model i must train my AI model using the training dataset. During training the model learns to identify patterns and relationships between the different parameters and the corresponding stock market outcomes.&#x20;

### Tests

| Test | Instructions  | What I expect     | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code      | Thing happens     | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Press buttons | Something happens | As expected           | Pass      |
