# 2.2.2 Cycle 2

## Design

1. Firstly i need to gather historical stock market data for the stocks I would like to be able to predict. I can obtain this data from financial data providers like fool.co.uk or yahoo finance. From these websites i must take key data that is important like stock prices, trading volumes and other important parameters.
2. After collecting this data i must look through it. I must remove any inconsistent values or anomalies as the AI would see this data and change its prediction methods due to anomalous results leading to less accurate predictions a large majority of the time. I must also split the data into data i will use to train the AI and data i will use to test the AI.&#x20;
