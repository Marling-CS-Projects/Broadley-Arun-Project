# 2.2.6 Cycle 6 : Doing the Analysis in APP

## Design

In this cycle I'm going to attempt to do the analysis I did within the application. To do so I plan to install a statistical package to do the actual regression analysis, I will then have to sort the data out to allow me to do the statistics. I'll then build a very basic API to view the outputs.

### Objectives

* [x] Find and Install an open source statistics package to do the Regression Analysis.
* [x] Convert my array data to the correct format for the stats package.
* [x] Display Regression Analysis Output on Analysis Component



### Outcomes

#### The Linear Regression Package

I found a blog on a company website 'Seabourn Consulting; that went through a number of open-source options that could be used to do Regression analysis.&#x20;

Linear Regression libraries
{% endembed %}

of all the options my preferred one was ml.js  ( [https://github.com/mljs/ml](https://github.com/mljs/ml))  because:

1. It seemed to have more documentation than many of the others.
2. It implements other regression tests like Polynomial regression and even some AI Networking ones. This could be useful if I have enough time at the end of my project.
3. It has good examples I can use to help me build my code.
4. Its open source.&#x20;

To install the package you need to do :

#### Use Linear Regression package to calculate results

Using the examples provided by the stats package it was really easy to get my data in the correct format for the analysis. I just had to get an array for the X Axis and one for the Y Axis. And call the constructor of the Linear regression class with those as parameters and the results pop out.

#### Display Regression Analysis Output on Analysis Component

I decided that the i would put the results on the left hand of the Analysis component with some information describing what the results meant. I would then have a chart on right hand side with a scatter diagram on the right hand side with the line of best fit.

### Challenges

Compared to some of the other cycles this one went quite well, my main problem was finding a Linear Regression library in javascript that was simple enough for me to use once I found ml.js everything went well.

### Testing

<table><thead><tr><th width="65">Tests</th><th width="208">Instructions</th><th width="160">What I expect</th><th width="266">What actually happens</th><th>Pass/Fail</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Select USA and Apple. Then do Analysis on 'Date' / 'Closing Price' Daily</td><td>Results to appear on LHS pain.</td><td>I see some results on LHS. The Chi2 number, though says NaN. Which means not a number</td><td>Fail</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Retest</td><td></td><td>Error in date going into Linear Regression class.</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td> Do Same as 1. But test values against what I get from my excel sheet built in last Cycle</td><td>I expect the answers for R, R2 and Chi2 to be the same</td><td>Answers were within 0.1 of the answers in Excel sheet. I think the difference is caused by differences in how both handle invalid data.</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Run a number of other Linear regression with other stocks, make sure in general they work.</td><td>Working outputs with no NaN's.</td><td>A couple of other stocks showed NaN's these seem to come from the history data where I've let them into the data.</td><td>Fail</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Retest</td><td></td><td>Retested after fixing 3 issues. One where I was dividing by zero, and another where I had mistyped a couple of the variable names.</td><td>Pass</td></tr></tbody></table>
