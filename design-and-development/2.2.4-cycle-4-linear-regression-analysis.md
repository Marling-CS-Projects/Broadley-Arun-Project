### Using Linear Regression to Predict Stock Market Prices

Introduction

There are many companies and people who try to forecast stock market movements using many methods, everything from charting to AI and sometimes even linear regression. This means that using these approaches successfully you are battling against all those other people out there.

Linear regression is one of the statistical methods that can be used to help analyse historical data and find relationships between different factors, In my case I can use it to analyse factors such as trading volume, insider trading, seasons etc and historical stock price to work how coupled these factors are.

### Understanding Linear Regression

Linear regression is a statistical method that calculates the relationship between a 'depended variable' (in this case stock price) and one or more independent variable (such as trading volume, insider trading, seasons, day of the week) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. The linear equations take the form: y =mx + c

* β Represents the slope which indicates how Y changes for a unit change in X
* α Represents the y intercept which would be the value of y if x is 0.

Using Historical Data

To use linear regression for predicting stock prices I must start by collecting historical data, which includes daily or hourly stock prices, trading volumes, and other relevant variables. The data should go over a large time frame to see different market conditions and trends.



## Different Parameters

1. Volume and Stock Prices: One of the factors I did consider is trading volume. High trading volume generally goes with big price movements. Linear regression can help show if there is a relationship between trading volume and stock price changes. A positive correlation would show that higher trading volume tends to lead to price increases, while a negative correlation would show the opposite.
2. Insider Trading: Insider trading data will also be used. The idea is to investigate whether stock price movements can be predicted in anyway by trading activities of insiders within the company. Linear regression can help quantify the impact of insider trading on stock prices, assuming that this data is available and reliable.
3. Seasonal Trends: There are differences in stock prices due to seasonal changes. For example, the "January effect" describes how compared to other months there is a higher chance  for stocks to perform well in January. Linear regression can be used to model and predict these seasonal patterns by considering the month or season as an independent variable.
4. Day of the Week Effects**:** Some studies have found that stock prices show different movements depending on the day of the week. Linear regression can be applied to examine whether there are consistent price patterns on specific days. For example, the "Monday effect" is just like the January effect but suggests that on average comparative to other days of the week stock prices tend to be lower

### Analysing and Interpreting the Results

Once linear regression models are made using historical data and the chosen independent variables, it's important to look through the results correctly:

* Value of Coefficient: Determine whether the coefficients have any statistical significance. A lower p-value shows that the parameter chosen (eg, day of the week) has a significant impact on stock prices.
* Interpretation of Coefficient: Interpret the coefficients to understand what the value means and in what direction its indicating. A positive coefficient indicates a positive correlation, while a negative coefficient implies a negative correlation.
* R-squared Value: Decide how good the fit of the model using the R-squared value. A higher R-squared shows that the model goes over a larger portion of the variance in stock prices.

###

### Limitations and Considerations

While linear regression can be a valuable tool in stock market analysis, it's necessary to understand its limitations:

1. Complex nature of markets: Financial markets are influenced by many factors, many of which are almost impossible to understand or predict accurately. Linear regression models oversimplify this complexity.
2. Market Dynamics: Financial markets are subject to sudden changes known as "market shocks," which linear regression models may struggle to predict.
