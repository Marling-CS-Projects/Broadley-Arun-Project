Using Linear Regression to Predict Stock Market Prices

Introduction

Predicting stock prices with great precision is basically impossible due to the complex and random nature of stock prices but linear regression is one of the statistical tools that can help analyze historical data and find  relationships between various factors and stock price movements. In this cycle I will delve into how linear regression can be employed to predict stock market prices by considering various factors such as trading volume, insider trading, seasons, day of the week, and historical data.

Understanding Linear Regression

Linear regression is a model that seeks to show the relationship between a dependent variable (in this case, stock prices) and one  more independent variables (such as trading volume, insider trading, seasons, and day of the week) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. The linear equation takes the form:



$$Y=a+bX+ε$$

Where:

* $$YY$$ represents the dependent variable (stock price).
* $$XX$$ represents the independent variable (e.g., trading volume, insider trading, etc.).
* $$aa$$ is the intercept, which represents the value of $$YY$$ when $$XX$$ is zero.
* $$bb$$ is the slope of the line, indicating how $$YY$$ changes for a unit change in $$XX$$.
* $$\varepsilonε$$ represents the error term, which accounts for unexplained variations in $$YY$$.

Using Historical Data

To use linear regression for predicting stock prices, we start by collecting historical data, which includes daily or hourly stock prices, trading volumes, and other relevant variables. The data should cover a substantial time frame to capture different market conditions and trends.
