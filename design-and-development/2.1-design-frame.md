# 2.1 Design Frame

## Systems Diagram

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (21).png>)

This chart shows the different tasks I need to do to complete my project. I've colour-coded each task showing whether It must be done, should be done or could be done.  I will focus on the 'Must' and 'Should' tasks first and leave the 'Could's until the end when I will know how well I'm doing in time.

## Getting The Data

The main part of this project is getting the historical data on stock price movements for selected stocks, At this point I've decided to use a paid for service from www.eodhd.com, the main reason behind choosing them is that they have lots of documentation and examples which should make it easier to do the build. From their documentation it looks like I can get history for the following:

* Stock Price
* Volume
* Insider Purchase
* Insider Sales
* News Article Count
* News Article Sentiment
* Growth

### Aim

Create a function that allows the user to download the above information consistently from EODHD.COM and structure it in a way that we can then do an analysis of the collected data.



## The Calculations

I have decided to base most of the predictions I'm trying to make from Linear Regression. I will use one of the open Javascript Statistics packages to do the actual calculation. I also plan to spend some time setting up the calculations in Excel. This will allow me to test the results coming from the statistics libray.

### Aim

Calculate Linear Regression scores such as Chi2, R2  and R from the data we download from EODHD.com and have some way of testing those results.

### User Interface

My project is not primarily focused on the User Interface. Its more on the Data, Analysis & Predictions. The UI, though, has to be good enough that anyone could use the solution to find stocks and then do the analysis to see if there are any relationships between any of the variables.

**AIM**

Build a simple user interface to allow users to find stocks they wish to analyze and the simply investigate the relationship between those variables.
