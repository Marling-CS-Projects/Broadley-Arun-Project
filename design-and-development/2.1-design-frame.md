## Systems Diagram

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (21).png>)

This chart shows the different tasks I need to do to complete in my project. I've colour coded each task specifying whether It must be done, should be done or could be done.  I will focus on the 'Must' and 'Should' tasks first and leave the 'Could's until the end when I will know how well I'm doing in time.

## Getting The Data

The main part of this project is getting the historical data on stock price movements for selected stocks, At this point I've decided to use a paid for service from www.eodhd.com, the main reason behind choosing them is that they have lots of documentation and examples which should make it easier to do the build. From their documentation it looks like I can get history for the following:

* Stock Price
* Volume
* Insider Purchase
* Insider Sales
* News Article Count
* News Article Sentiment
* Growth

### Aim

Create a function that allows the user to download the above information consistently from EODHD.COM and structures it in away that we can then do analysis on the collected data.



## The Calculations

Usability is an important aspect to my game as I want it to be accessible to all. There are 5 key points of usability to create the best user experience that I will be focusing on when developing my project. These are:

### User Interface

Users can achieve the goal with completeness and accuracy. To do this, I will make the levels simplified and not complicated to navigate. This also ties into my point I mentioned earlier about making the game fair but challenging - this will create an effective gameplay for the user.
