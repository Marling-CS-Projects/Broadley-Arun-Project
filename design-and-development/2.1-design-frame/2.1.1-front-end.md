<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (71).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Angular Components</p></figcaption></figure>

The Front end will be a SPA (Single page application) written in Angular/Typescrpt and will be split up into the following components.

### Header Component

The header component will contain two material design auto-complete fields one for the exchange and one for the stock selection.

both fields will do a filter and show a dropdown of filtered items when the user partially types in an exchange or stock.

PseudoCode for stock filter.:

### Aim

The component should allow the user to search for stocks they want to analyze across the 60 stock market exchanges that EOD supports.

### Info Component

Once a user has used the header component to select a stock. The system will display information about that stock. This will come from the EOD fundamentals API we will use.

Fields to display:

* Stock Code
* Head office Address
* Stock Description
* Employees
* Stories
* Exchange

This will just use standard HTML controls.&#x20;

### Aim

User should be able to see enough information about a selected stock to make sure its the stock you were looking for and some basic information about it.

### History Component

The history component will show a table with one row for each date that I have a closing price for, showing all the historical data for each date. To do this I will need to merge data from a number of the API's.

Here's the pseudo code for the data merge:





### Aim

Component will allow merge the data from each of the EOD API's and get it ready for the Analysis and AutoAnalysis components.
