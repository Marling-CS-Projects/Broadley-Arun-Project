# 2.1.2 Backend Design

The design of my backend is as simple as I can make it. The only reason for the back end is to hide the EOD API token from the front end user.

My plan is to simply 'Proxy' the calls I need to the EOD API from the frontend adding the API Token required by EOD. This will allow the frontend not to need to know the EOD API token.

I plan on taking the sample [https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html) application and extending it to cope with my 6 API calls. The results the webcall to EOD will be immediately transferred to the frontend with no processing in the back-end whatsover.

I have never had to write a backend before but looking at the sample start application it looks like it should not be too difficult.
