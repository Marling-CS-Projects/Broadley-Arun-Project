# 2.1.1 Front-End

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (71).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>mergesAngular Components</p></figcaption></figure>

The Front end will be a SPA (Single page application) written in Angular/Typescrpt and will be split up into the following components.

### Header Component

The header component will contain two material design auto-complete fields one for the exchange and one for the stock selection.

both fields will do a filter and show a dropdown of filtered items when the user partially types in an exchange or stock.

PseudoCode for stock filter.:

#### Aim

The component should allow the user to search for stocks they want to analyze across the 60 stock market exchanges that EOD supports.

### Info Component

Once a user has used the header component to select a stock. The system will display information about that stock. This will come from the EOD fundamentals API we will use.

Fields to display:

* Stock Code
* Head office Address
* Stock Description
* Employees
* Stories
* Exchange

This will just use standard HTML controls.&#x20;

#### Aim

User should be able to see enough information about a selected stock to make sure it's the stock they were looking for and some other basic information about it.

### History Component

The history component will show a table with one row for each date that I have a closing price for, showing all the historical data for each date. To do this I will need to merge data from a number of the API's.

Each one of the merges should be very similar as we are using the closing date field to merge on.

#### Aim

The component will display to users the base data that they can use to analyze the stock in a table to allow them to scroll through the data and also check to ensure the data used in the analysis component is correct.

### Analysis Component

The plan for the analysis component is that it will allow the user to select the inputs for the linear regression:

* X- Axis - One of the inputs, Season, Day of Week, Volume, sentiment, Insider Dealing etc
* Y - Axis  - Growth or closing price
* Timing - Daily, weekly, Monthly, Quarterly.

The component will then have a 'Calculate' button which will call the linear regression library to calculate the results.

Once the results are calculated the screen will then show:

* the results of the linear regression run R, RSquared, ChiSquared with an explanation of what they mean.
* A scatter plot graph plotting the X and Y Coords on a chart. This will allow the user to visually see if there is a correlation between the inputs.
* A regression line on the chart, showing the correlation, we should expect the line to not be flat if there is a correlation.

**Aim**

The aim of the analysis component is to allow the user to manually look at the data I have downloaded and see if they can find patterns using linear regression. The scatter diagram plus the regression line should then be enough for them to be able to work out how well the 2 axis correlate.

### AutoAnalysis Component

The autoanalysis component will allow the user to automate the analysis of the stock by running a number of linear regressions on the stock history looking for the best correlation. It will do this by running a fixed set of tests and then showing a table ordered by RSquared. The hightest is the one that correlates most.

All the calculated outputs for the linear regressions will be shown in a Table ordered by RSquared.

#### Aim

The aim of this component is to allow the user to easily find correlations between the data by running all the tests I can think of in an automated manner. When the user finds the best correlation he can then run it in the Analysis section to see the detail.
