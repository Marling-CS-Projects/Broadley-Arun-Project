# 2.2.5 Cycle 5 Excel Analysis

## Design

in this cycle i am going to build my analysis in excel. This will allow me to build a prototype of the calculations before trying to do it in the application. this would also allow me to have some way of testing the final results from the application.



Also i need to work out why the EOD sentiment and insider API's doesn't seem to return data before august 2022, this will make it difficult to calculate anything sensible. Their documentation seems to say they have data for these API's going back 10 years.

### Objectives



* [x] input source data from app&#x20;
* [x] Build analysis columns.
* [x] produce scatter diagrams of sentiment, volume, insider purchases, against growth.
* [x] Calculate linear regression using an independent variable.
* [ ] Investigate EOD API problem.



### Outcomes

I created an excel sheet by downloading the calculated data from my App for 'AAPL.US' and then created the following calculated columns:

* Date
* Season - which season the date is in.
* Calendar Month - Calendar month of the date
* Daily Growth - Growth between this line and the next.
* Weekly Growth - The growth that happens from this line to 1 week in the future.
* 4 Weekly Growth - The growth that happens from this line to 4 weeks in the future.
* 12 Weekly Growth - The growth that happens between date of this stock price and 12 weeks in the future.

I then added 2 more columns using the indirect function to allow me to easily choose the two columns to run the regression test on. I also added a scatter diagram with a trend line.

Excel has an add-in that allows you to do linear regression. I installed it and then did the regression tests, I then ran the test on the Sentiment and 4 weekly Growh columns which produced regression coefficient, basically sayint that there was no correlation between the two columns!.

**EOD API Issues**

I found it difficult to talk to the EOD support team, eventually they sent an email saying that the data they hold was dependent on the actual stock. I have now asked what Stocks they would hold more data for... Still waiting for the reply.

### Challenges

I've never really used excel to do this sort of complex calculations, especially difficult for me was converting the string that I get from EOD 'AUG 3, 2000' into an actual excel date.&#x20;

Most of the rest was researched using google and you-tube!.
