# 2.2.9 Cycle 9 - Backend Server

## Design

One of the main problems with the work we have done so far is that the calls to EOD are all done from the frontend Javascripts. This is bad as it means that its very easy for someone to find our API-Key, they could then use it to rack up huge costs by using it themselves. What I need to do to stop this is create my own back-end and call it from the front end any time I need to get data from EOD. The back-end would securely hold the API Key and use it to answer requests from the front-end.

The back-end server technology that goes well with Angular is Node/express.

As I've never written a back-end before I will take a Node/Express template back-end server and modify it.

### Objectives



* [x] Implement basic Node/Express back-end server.
* [x] Create API's for all the calls to EOD API's in the front-end.
  * [ ] exchange-list
  * [ ] fundamentals
  * [ ] insider-transactions
  * [ ] eod&#x20;
  * [ ] exchange-symbol-list
  * [ ] sentiments
* [x] Update frontend to (optionally) use Backend Server.

### Outcomes

#### Implement the 4 required EOD API's

The historical data I need for the analysis cycle is split up in 4 different API's

* End of Day API
