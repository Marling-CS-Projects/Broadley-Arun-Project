# 2.2.7 Cycle 7 - Setting up the Regression Chart

## Design

In this cycle I want to create a scatter chart of the regression analysis with a line of best fit using. Im going to try and use High-charts, which is a powerful JavaScript library for data visualization.&#x20;

### Objectives

* [x] Set up and install high-charts
* [x] Add html tags to analysis component
* [x] Update chart with regression values
* [x] Calculate and display line of best fit

### Outcomes

* **set up and install high-charts:**

To install highcharts i used the tutorial on the highcharts website which told me to do the following:&#x20;

Once installed i set up a simple chat to make sure all was working.

* **Add html tags to analysis component**

I added the following html to the analysis component this is the placeholder for where the chart is displayed all the configuration is setup in code.

* **Update chart with regression values**

now i need to fill in the x and y coordinates of each of the points i want to show. I do this by adding x y coordinates to the highcharts data series:

The minx and maxx will be used for the next objective.



* **Calculate and display line of best fit**

Highcharts has the ability to show 2 series on the one chart. I will use this ti show a line graph using the line of best fit that my stats package calculates. Once i do this by calculating two points on that line and feeding those coordinates into the second data series.

### Testing:



<table><thead><tr><th>Expected Output</th><th width="313">Output</th><th>Tick/Cross</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Line of best fit correlating with data.</td><td>Line of best fit correlates with data. Gradient always matches line.</td><td><a href="https://fsymbols.com/signs/tick/">✅</a></td></tr><tr><td>When  "analysis" is clicked graph appears with appropriate data</td><td>A graph does appear with appropiate data when "analysis" button is clicked.</td><td><a href="https://fsymbols.com/signs/tick/">✅</a></td></tr><tr><td>On the left hand side of graph there should be different key data points with definitions of what they mean and the significance of the value.</td><td>All of this is done</td><td><a href="https://fsymbols.com/signs/tick/">✅</a></td></tr></tbody></table>
