# 2.2.7 Cycle 7 - Setting up the Regression Chart

## Design

I have  created a regression chart using High-charts this is a powerful JavaScript library for data visualization. This chart displays a simple scatter plot with a linear regression line. In this cycle i will go through the steps I followed to accomplish this task.

**1. HTML Setup:** I started by setting up the basic structure of my HTML file. This template starts a spot for the chart to be with a specified width and height to ensure it fits well into my project:

**2. JavaScript Setup:** Within the `<script>` tag in the `<body>` section, I wrote JavaScript code to create the regression chart. Here's a breakdown of what I did:

* I defined sample data for the independent (`xData`) and dependent (`yData`) variables, which I had prepared for my project.
* To calculate the regression coefficients (slope and intercept), I used a  `linearRegression` function.&#x20;
* I created a Highcharts chart by specifying its type (scatter graph) and data series.
* I included two series: one for the scatter plot (representing data points) and another for the regression line. In each series, the `data` attribute was used to define the points to be plotted.

**3. Testing and Deployment:** After completing the code, I saved the HTML file and opened the project in a web browser to thoroughly test the chart. I ensured that it met my project's requirements in terms of appearance and functionality.&#x20;
