# 2.2.7 Cycle 7 - Setting up the Regression Chart

##

## Design

In this cycle I want to create a scatter chart of the regression analysis with a line of best fit using. Im going to try and use High-charts, which is a powerful JavaScript library for data visualization.&#x20;



### Objectives

* [x] set up and install high-charts
* [x] add html tags to analysis component
* [x] update chart with regression values
* [x] calculate and display line of best fit



**1. HTML Setup:** I started by setting up the basic structure of my HTML file. This template starts a spot for the chart to be with a specified width and height to ensure it fits well into my project:

**2. JavaScript Setup:** Within the `<script>` tag in the `<body>` section, I wrote JavaScript code to create the regression chart. Here's a breakdown of what I did:

* I defined sample data for the independent (`xData`) and dependent (`yData`) variables, which I had prepared for my project.





### Outcomes

* **set up and install high-charts:**

To install highcharts i used the tutorial on the highcharts website which told me to do the following:&#x20;

Once installed i set up a simple chat to make sure all was working.

* **add html tags to analysis component**

I added the following html to the analysis component this is the placeholder for where the chart is displayed all the configuration is setup in code.

* **update chart with regression values**

now i need to fill in the x and y coordinates of each of the points i want to show. I do this by adding x y coordinates to the highcharts data series:

The minx and maxx will be used for the next objective.
