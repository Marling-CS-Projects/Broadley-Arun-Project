# 2.2.7 Cycle 7 - Setting up the Regression Chart

## Design

I have  created a regression chart using High-charts this is a powerful JavaScript library for data visualization. This chart displays a simple scatter plot with a linear regression line. In this cycle i will go through the steps I followed to accomplish this task.

**1. HTML Setup:** I started by setting up the basic structure of my HTML file. This template starts a spot for the chart to be with a specified width and height to ensure it fits well into my project:

**2. JavaScript Setup:** Within the `<script>` tag in the `<body>` section, I wrote JavaScript code to create the regression chart. Here's a breakdown of what I did:

* I defined sample data for the independent (`xData`) and dependent (`yData`) variables, which I had prepared for my project.
*   Linear regression is a  statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (y) and one independent variables (x). The goal is to find the best-fitting linear equation that describes this relationship. This equation is  in the form of y = mx + c, where "m" represents the slope (the coefficient) of the line, and "b" represents the intercept. Calculating these coefficients involves several steps.

    First, you need a dataset with paired values of x and y. Then, calculate the means of both x and y. Next, calculate the differences between each x-value and the mean of x  and between each y-value and the mean of y. Calculate the product of x and y for each data point, and also calculate the squared values of x.

    The slope is determined by taking the sum of the product of x and y divided by the sum of the squared Δx values. The intercept  is found by subtracting m times the mean of x from the mean of y. With these coefficients, you have the equation of the best-fit line, which can be used for prediction, analysis, and understanding the relationship between the variables. I had to to these calculations first as this is the data i will input and show visually using highcharts\

* Implementing a Highcharts chart for linear regression is a process that transforms data analysis into a graph. It begins with the preparation of pieces of data and selecting certain parameters to be the independent and dependent variables. to start the implementation i had to calculate the regression coefficients, like slope and intercept which i described in detail above. Once these values are determined, Highcharts comes into play, allowing you to create an interactive chart. By using a scatter plot to display your data points and including a regression line, you can show how well the model fits your data. Highcharts allows you to customize the chart by adjusting labels, legends, tooltips, and colors to match your requirements.&#x20;
* I included two series: one for the scatter plot (representing data points) and another for the regression line. In each series, the data attribute was used to define the points to be plotted.

**3. Testing and Deployment:** After completing the code, I saved the HTML file and opened the project in a web browser to thoroughly test the chart. I ensured that it met my project's requirements in terms of appearance and functionality.&#x20;
