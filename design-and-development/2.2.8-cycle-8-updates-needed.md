# 2.2.8 Cycle 8 - Updates Needed

## Design

In this cycle, i want to do some user interface tidy-ups and some basic component updates that are needed as I've not done any since I started to do the system. I need to do this because a number of components now have security issues.

I also want to sort out the UI, it's meant to use one of the material design themes but for some reason isn't. I also want to update the History component to automatically show the history of the stock without pressing the refresh button.&#x20;

### Objectives

* [x] Update Angular version from v14-V15 , U\[date Material design from v14 - v15
* [x] Update frontend to property use material design theme.
* [x] Update the history component to automatically show the history
* [x] Update the history component to show all the calculated fields formatted well.

### Outcomes

#### Update Angular & Material Design.

Updating versions is initially easy. all I needed to do was run:

After this, though you need to look for items that don't work or have been deprecated and fix. Almost all the includes were changed and a bunch of other components had errors, it took almost a day to fix all of them propertly.

#### **Update frontend to property use material design theme.**

Almost since i started doing this project I've had a problem with the theme's on the material design components not working well. You can see what I mean from this screenshot:

There are lots of issues, the Colour scheme is not correct. The tabs only show the current active tab other one is invisible. the size of the fonts is wrong, there are just lots and lots of issues.

As it turns out I've not been including the default them styles in my global styles.css. It's apparently a problem with the default template for material. This is as simple as including:

In my styles.scss file. After I do this the application looks like this.  Much better for a one line change!.

#### **History Component Updates.**

To make it easier to debug I wanted to fix a number of usability issues with the History component. I wanted to update it to do the following:

* Automatically run a refresh&#x20;

I managed this by using a lifeCycle hook '"AfterViewInit" and automatically refreshing the grid when this happens.

* Improve the table to include all the columns used for Analysis

Initially I was only showing the data I got back from EOD for the stock history, I wanted to add all the values I'm calculating for the analysis 'DayOfWeek', 'Season', "DayGrowth", "WeekGrowth", "Week4Growth", "Week12Growth". I did this by updating the HTML on the history component for the table to have these fields.

* Improve formatting of numbers and %ages.

Again quite simple. I added some properties to the StockHistory class that calculated nicely formatted string values which I could use for the table.
