# 2.2.8 Cycle 8 - Updates Needed

## Design

In this cycle, i want to do some user interface tidy-ups and some basic component updates that are needed as I've not done any since I started to do the system. I need to do this because a number of components now have security issues.

I also want to sort out the UI, it's meant to use one of the material design themes but for some reason isn't. I also want to update the History component to automatically show the history of the stock without pressing the refresh button.&#x20;

### Objectives

* [x] Update Angular version from v14-V15 , U\[date Material design from v14 - v15
* [x] Update frontend to property use material design theme.
* [x] Update the history component to automatically show history
* [x] Update the history component to show all the calculated fields formated well.

### Outcomes

#### Update Angular & Material Design.

Updating versions is initially easy. all I needed to do was run:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

After this, though you need to look for items that don't work or have been deprecated and fix. Almost all the includes were changed and a bunch of other components had errors, it took almost a day to fix all of them propertly.

#### **Update frontend to property use material design theme.**

Almost since i started doing this project I've had a problem with the theme's on the material design components not working well. You can see what I mean from this screenshot:

There are lots of issues, the Colour scheme is not correct. The tabs only show the current active tab other one is invisible. the size of the fonts is wrong, there are just lots and lots of issues.

As it turns out I've not been including the default them styles in my global styles.css. It's apparently a problem with the default template for material. This is as simple as including:

In my styles.scss file. After I do this the application looks like this.  Much better for a one line change!.

## Testing



### Tests

<table><thead><tr><th width="85">Tests</th><th>Instructions</th><th>What I expect</th><th>What actually happens</th><th>Pass/Fail</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Test front end retrieval of data with : London, Lloyds  and USA, Apple</td><td>To see history for each selected stock</td><td>Worked</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Retrieve data for LLoyds, London and then check data on the 1st of August to see of correct</td><td>See if stock price is 42.8 (Got from Yahoo Finance)</td><td>stock price was 42.8</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Once London exchange selected. Type 'LLoyds' into stock selection box</td><td>I expect to see the stock tickers containing LLoyds in there name.</td><td>Front end shows 3 entries all with LLoyds in there title.</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Search US, Apple then check news story count and sentiment for 10th August 2023</td><td>I can't check underlying data but check against direct API call: should see 14 Stories and 0.84 for sentiment</td><td>I saw 14 stories and 0.84 for sensitivity</td><td>Pass</td></tr></tbody></table>
