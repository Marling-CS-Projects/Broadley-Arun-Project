# 2.2.10 Cycle 10 - Adding Auto-analysis Feature

## Design

In this next cycle of my project, I'm introducing a new addition: the "Auto-Analysis" feature. This feature is designed to make it easier for users to discover which parameters have the most significant correlation with stock market growth.

Here's how it works:

1. **Correlation Calculation**: The auto analysis feature goes through all the available parameters and calculates using linear regression how correlated they are to stock growth.
2. **Ordering Parameters**: When all the correlations of each parameter is calculated the auto analysis feature organises each parameter in order of how correlated they are to stock market growth. The parameter with the highest correlation to stock market growth will be at the top of the list and least at the bottom of the list.&#x20;
3. **User-Friendly Display**: To make all this extra information as clear as possible I've created a separate tab on the website for this feature. When users click on this tab, they'll see a table. In this table, the parameter with the highest correlation is at the very top. The table then lists the other parameters in a simple and easy way maximising readability.&#x20;

### Objectives

* [x] Calculate regression values for a number of different parameters.
* [x] Show results sorted by r2 in a material design table.
* [ ] Calculate forecast stock price.
* [ ] Show forecast.

## Outcomes

**Calculate regression values for a number of different parameters.**

First, I started by adding all the different parameters that I've allowed users to find correlations with and I've added them all to an array, inside this array I've used the function "doRegression" to perform regression analysis on these parameters to find different information like the "slope", "gradient" and most importantly r^2. I then at the bottom of this screenshot added a comparator function which I used to sort the array. This will display in the auto-analysis section an ordered list going from the parameter with the highest correlation with growth to the lowest.

**Show results sorted by r2 in a material design table.**

I copied the html table definition from the history component and modified it to display the fields returned by the "doRegression" function. one issue i had was date formats as i found it hard to get them in British format.

#### Calculate forecast stock price.

To do this I changed the doRegression function to calculate a forecast for each regression it was running and return them to the calling function. I used the line of best fit calculated by the linear regression routine to calculate the forecast.
