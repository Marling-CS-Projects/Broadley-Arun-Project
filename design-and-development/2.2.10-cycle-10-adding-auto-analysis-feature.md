# 2.2.10 Cycle 10 - Adding Auto-analysis Feature

## Design

In this cycle i will add an extra feature to my project which will be an auto-analysis feature. This auto analysis feature will go through and calculate the correlation between growth and each parameter, after finding this information the website will order all parameters by correlation with growth. This will allow the user to find out quickly which parameter correlates with growth the most significantly and this could be very useful. This will be on a seperate tab on my website and will be displayed on a table.

US for the echange and AAPL.US</td><td>We should be able to see the results that will be went to the calling application.</td><td>Worked</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Using chrome test each API endpoint with invalid parameters. use 'bbbb.US' as stock code when required.</td><td>API should return 404 error.</td><td>Worked, except for the Exchange-List API that always just returns the exchange list. So good</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Check that .ENV file does not end up in Git</td><td>check that the API Key does not end up in GIT.</td><td>Worked</td><td>Pass</td></tr></tbody></table>
