# 4.1 Evaluation of Success Criteria



<table><thead><tr><th width="154">Ref. No.</th><th>Criterion</th><th>Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Application has Drop down box allowing the user to select Stock to analyse</td><td><ul><li>This is a necessary feature to allow the whole application to work</li></ul></td><td><a href="../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#feature-1-search-box">SearchBox </a></td></tr></tbody></table>



This criterion has been successfully fulfilled. In order to provide users with access to a wide array of exchanges and stocks for which I had data, I chose to use 2 dropdown boxes, one to show exchanges and another to show stocks. This selection method not only proved to be efficient but also user friendly for showing these options.         &#x20;

<table><thead><tr><th width="154">Ref. No.</th><th>Criterion</th><th>Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td><td>Application has page allowing you to see basic information of the stock selected. Its History etc.</td><td>This page will allow the user to get some information on the stock before seeing the analysis</td><td><a href="../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#feature-2-viewing-historical-stock-data">Info Page</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

This criterion has been successfully completed. My target was to make all data I have access to  about the stocks accessible to users so they could make the most informed decisions possible. I accomplished this by presenting the data in the form of a table with columns and rows representing various parameters and key data points.

<table><thead><tr><th width="154">Ref. No.</th><th>Criterion</th><th>Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3</td><td>My application has analysis page showing results of regression testing. Plus graphs of our forecast.</td><td>This is the result page</td><td><a href="../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#specific-feature-3-analysis-interface">Analysis Page</a></td></tr></tbody></table>



This criterion was successfully completed. In the analysis page the results of regression testing are displayed on a graph with explanations of the significance of each regression value to the left of the graph. For instance, the 'r^2' value is displayed to the left of the graph, and is explained as the representation of the correlation between the two different parameters.  On the graph a line of best fit was drawn which shows the forecast, if you look up the x value in it you can read off your forecast from the y axis.





<table><thead><tr><th width="154">Ref. No.</th><th>Criterion</th><th>Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>4</td><td>My application shows the results of the linear regression Model. On whether I should or should not buy this stock.</td><td>This is the results page</td><td><a href="../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#specific-feature-3-analysis-interface">Analysis Page</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

This criterion is partially achieved. My application shows the results of the linear regression calculation in a clear way. However, it does not provide a definitive recommendation on whether the user should buy or not buy a stock. Although the application shows users data that provides strong indications to certain decisions it never definitively tells the users to do anything.

Upon reflection, I think that I may have written this success criteria incorrectly. I now think that a platform made to help people in making investment decisions based on probability should not definitively tell users the actions they should take. This is because there is always uncertainty in trying to predict the future.&#x20;





<table><thead><tr><th width="154">Ref. No.</th><th>Criterion</th><th>Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>5</td><td>Application has some way of doing an auto analysis to see which fields have most correlation to growth.</td><td>This is the AutoAnalysis Page.</td><td>Auto Analysis Page</td></tr></tbody></table>

This criterion is completely successful, in the auto analysis tab if you click "calculate" small writing will show up at the top left of the screen saying which parameter correlates the most to stock growth.&#x20;



<table><thead><tr><th width="94">Ref. No.</th><th width="218">Criterion</th><th width="299">Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>I will need to create a  server with an API to allow my front end to work. Most of these API's will just simply give me back data from EODHistoricalData.com.</td><td>This will be required to make the system work.</td><td><a href="../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#feature-2-viewing-historical-stock-data">Info Page</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

This criterion was completely successful and was quite simple and quick to complete.

<table><thead><tr><th width="94">Ref. No.</th><th width="218">Criterion</th><th width="299">Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td><td>API : Stock Info for Search box</td><td>I will need an API that I can call that will return data for my search box. The drop-down search box needs to be clever enough so that when the user types in 'AAPL' it can give the user options that contain AAPL. (Apple.</td><td><a href="../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#feature-1-search-box">SearchBox </a></td></tr></tbody></table>

The dropdown boxes are working perfectly and are displaying the data needed for the user to use my website effectively.

<table><thead><tr><th width="94">Ref. No.</th><th width="218">Criterion</th><th width="299">Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3</td><td>API : Detailed Stock Info</td><td>I will need to create an API that when given the stock ticker from the search above gathers together the required data for the Info Page and for any analysis required.</td><td><a href="../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#feature-2-viewing-historical-stock-data">Info Page</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

When stock is selected history and data of stock displays perfectly so this criterion is completely successful.

<table><thead><tr><th width="94">Ref. No.</th><th width="218">Criterion</th><th width="299">Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>4</td><td>API : Analysis Info</td><td>I will need to create an API that when given the stock ticker from the search above gathers together the required analysis data that can then be used to populate the analysis page.</td><td><a href="../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#specific-feature-3-analysis-interface">Analysis Page</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table><thead><tr><th width="103">Ref. No.</th><th width="253">Criterion</th><th width="287">Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>System will produce regression performance indicators that need to be calculated correctly.</td><td>We need these performance indicators to forecast.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

This criterion is 100% successful this can be seen in the analysis page, after clicking calculate all these regression values are to the left of the graph.

<table><thead><tr><th width="103">Ref. No.</th><th width="253">Criterion</th><th width="287">Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td><td>linear regression Model output needs to be clear enough for a user to interpret whether to buy or sell stocks.</td><td>Lots of linear regression  models produce output that is not understandable by people who do not have needed knowledge. Our output needs to be simpler.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

This criterion is partially achieved. My application shows the results of the linear regression calculation in a clear way. However, it does not provide a definitive recommendation on whether the user should buy or not buy a stock. Although the application shows users data that provides strong indications to certain decisions it never definitively tells the users to do anything.

Upon reflection, I think that I may have written this success criteria incorrectly. I now think that a platform made to help people in making investment decisions based on probability should not definitively tell users the actions they should take. This is because there is always uncertainty in trying to predict the future.&#x20;

<table><thead><tr><th width="103">Ref. No.</th><th width="253">Criterion</th><th width="287">Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3</td><td>System predictions must be more accurate than random chance over the last month of data.</td><td>This is the core requirement of the system.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>





<table><thead><tr><th width="76">Ref. No.</th><th width="137">Criterion</th><th width="399">Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Compatibility</td><td>UI must be compatible with the major browsers used. Chrome:64.9% , Safari is 19.5% with Edge: 4.6%  </td><td><a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/">https://gs.statcounter.com/</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

This criterion is completely 100% successful

<table><thead><tr><th width="76">Ref. No.</th><th width="137">Criterion</th><th width="399">Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td><td>Reliability</td><td>User Interface needs to be reliable and consistently work. Our target market is based around Retail Investors who may not by too IT Literate.</td><td>Stakeholder section.</td></tr></tbody></table>

If I look at my usability testing I got very positive results for all questions relating to this. Not one time did the website crash and all the components and data where very easy to understand so off this sample I would say this criterion was 100% successful.

<table><thead><tr><th width="76">Ref. No.</th><th width="137">Criterion</th><th width="399">Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3</td><td>Localisation</td><td>Front-end application needs to work in UK, EUROPE &#x26; the US. We will need to test things like number formats. We will not translate the front end into different languages.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

This criterion I partially failed as the system works in these 3 different locations, one problem is regional settings to do with number formats don't work for instance if the website is used in France it doesn't auto change to commas from dots.

<table><thead><tr><th width="76">Ref. No.</th><th width="137">Criterion</th><th width="399">Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>4</td><td>Legislation</td><td>Offering advice from a legal viewpoint is difficult. We will need to put in disclaimers. Ensuring the user does not use our forecast in his decision-making.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>



<table><thead><tr><th width="76">Ref. No.</th><th width="137">Criterion</th><th width="399">Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>5</td><td>Performance</td><td>the frontend UI needs to be performant. Apparently, a good metric is to say that the User should not have to wait more than 2 seconds for any action. The only actions that may take longer than this are the calculation actions where we warn the user it might take a long time to run.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

This criterion has been successful. I tested this by doing usability testing on 10 different users and they had rated the user interface all across the website very highly. They found 0 bugs to reports, no crashes and they said all the components where either a 4/5 or a 5/5 in speed. Doing my own testing i found nothing took longer then 2 seconds to load up even the auto analysis section so i think this criterion has been extremely successful.

<table><thead><tr><th width="76">Ref. No.</th><th width="137">Criterion</th><th width="399">Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>6</td><td>Scalabilty</td><td>I will setup the system to work with a minimum of 2 users at any time. These are called concurrent users.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

This criterion has been successful the goal was to allow 2 users to use the website at the same time and I've tested it with 4 users at the same time and it works perfectly.
