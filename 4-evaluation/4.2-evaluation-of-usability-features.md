### Feature 1: Exchange & Stock Autocomplete Fields

Intial Criteria: The component should allow the user to search for stocks they want to analyze across the 60 stock market exchanges that EOD supports.

The two autocomplete dropdown boxes on the Header component work effectively to allow a user to drill down and search for a specific stock they want to analyse. Part of this was the provision of filtering to remove all the non-stock indexes and bonds that were held in the EOD data.

### Feature 2 : Information Page

Intial Criteria: User should be able to see enough information about a selected stock to make sure it's the stock they were looking for and some other basic information about it.

I think this feature works well, I found that EOD holds quite a lot of 'Fundamental' information on a stock, So I built the page around the Description, size and sector information held by EOD.

### Feature 3: Stock History Page

Initial Criteria: The component will display to users the base data that they can use to analyze the stock in a table to allow them to scroll through the data and also check to ensure the data used in the analysis component is correct.

This feature worked well showing all the key pieces of data that you can then choose to analyse on in the Analysis features. This allows the user to check the historical data for the stock.&#x20;

### Feature 4: Linear Regression Results

Initial Criteria: The component will display to users the base data that they can use to analyze the stock in a table to allow them to scroll through the data and also check to ensure the data used in the analysis component is correct.

This feature worked well showing all the key pieces of data that you can then choose to analyse on in the Analysis features. This allows the user to check the historical data for the stock.&#x20;
