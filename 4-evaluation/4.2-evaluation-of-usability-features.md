# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

<table><thead><tr><th width="86.33333333333331">F.No.</th><th width="120">Component</th><th width="436">Description</th><th>Success/Fail</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Header</td><td>Exchange &#x26; Stock Autocomplete Fields</td><td>Success</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Info</td><td>Information Page</td><td>Success</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>History</td><td>Stock History</td><td>Success</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Analysis</td><td>Linear Regression Results &#x26; Chart</td><td>Partial Success</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Auto Analysis</td><td>Auto Analysis Functionality</td><td>Success</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Feature 1: Exchange & Stock Autocomplete Fields

Initial Criteria: The component should allow the user to search for stocks they want to analyze across the 60 stock market exchanges that EOD supports.

The two autocomplete dropdown boxes on the Header component work effectively to allow a user to drill down and search for a specific stock they want to analyse. Part of this was the provision of filtering to remove all the non-stock indexes and bonds that were held in the EOD data.

### Feature 2 : Information Page

Initial Criteria: The user should be able to see enough information about a selected stock to make sure it's the stock they were looking for and some other basic information about it.

I think this feature works well, I found that EOD holds quite a lot of 'Fundamental' information on a stock, So I built the page around the Description, size and sector information held by EOD.

### Feature 3: Stock History Page

Initial Criteria: The component will display to users the base data that they can use to analyze the stock in a table to allow them to scroll through the data and also check to ensure the data used in the analysis component is correct.

This feature worked well showing all the key pieces of data that you can then choose to analyse on in the Analysis features. This allows the user to check the historical data for the stock.&#x20;

### Feature 4: Linear Regression Results & Chart

Initial Criteria: The aim of the analysis component is to allow the user to manually look at the data I have downloaded and see if they can find patterns using linear regression. The scatter diagram plus the regression line should then be enough for them to be able to work out how well the 2 axis correlate

This feature worked well showing all the key pieces of data that you can then choose to analyse on in the Analysis features. This allows the user to check the historical data for the stock.&#x20;

### Feature 5: Auto Analysis Function

Initial Criteria: The aim of this component is to allow the user to easily find correlations between the data by running all the tests I can think of in an automated manner. When the system finds the best correlation the user can then run it in the Analysis section to see the detail.

This function does a good job of fixing the issue with my analysis function. It stops the user from having to run multiple regressions looking for the correlation but doing them all automatically. I think this really does implement the aim of the criteria.



## Efficient

### Feature 1 - Exchange & Stock Autocomplete Fields

Initial Criteria: The main criteria around efficiency was to ensure that the user does not wait for more than 2 seconds for any part of the system to display.

Largely for feature 1 this works, there are a few exchanges, for instance USA where the stock autocomplete fields take roughly 2 seconds to load, but the user is still able to use the system whilst this happens.

### Feature 4&5 - Auto and Analysis Functionality

Initial Criteria: The main criteria around efficiency was to ensure that the user does not wait for more than 2 seconds for any part of the system to display.

Success, even when running auto-anlysis feature on stocks with 20 years of historical data the 12 regression runs still take less than my 2 second limit on my laptop. This might fail on a less powerful PC. For instance a Chromebook or such, but on a normal PC it works well.



## Easy To Navigate & Understand

One of the main goals for building this application was to make the app easy to navigate and understand. This was because I felt that the Stakeholders who might actually use this app perhaps would not be very computer literate.

To ensure that the app would be easy to learn, I made sure that the use of the system would be somewhat linear.

a The user chooses a stock, then sees some information on the stock, the user then does an analysis and then sees the results of the analysis. This means that there are few paths through the actual system

<table><thead><tr><th width="86.33333333333331">F.No.</th><th width="120">Component</th><th width="436">Description</th><th>Success/Fail</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Header</td><td>Exchange &#x26; Stock Autocomplete Fields</td><td>Success</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Info</td><td>Information Page</td><td>Success</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Analysis</td><td>Linear Regression Results &#x26; Chart</td><td>Partial Success</td></tr></tbody></table>



### Feature 1 - Exchange & Stock Autocomplete Fields

Criteria: Easy to Navigate and Understand.

Whilst designing the system, I ensured that these two fields would work as either Dropdown or Autocomplete fields to ensure that the user did not need to know either the stock symbols or the exchanges.

One thing that I did not manage, though, was the user still needs to know which stock exchange the stock is a part of. Usually, this is location-specific, so for instance Philips is on the Netherlands exchange.&#x20;

### Feature 2 - Information Page

Criteria: Easy to Navigate and Understand.

The information page allows a user to make sure they have selected the correct stock by showing them some information about that stock. This makes the application much easier to Navigate and understand.

### Feature 4 - Analysis page

Criteria: Easy to Navigate and Understand.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I think the analysis page because of all the help describing the key variables from the regression test, helps the user understand the actual results. For instance, here we can see that the correlation between the 2 parameters we have chosen to analyse is very low at R=0.02362.

## Easy To Learn

<table><thead><tr><th width="86.33333333333331">F.No.</th><th width="120">Component</th><th width="436">Description</th><th>Success/Fail</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Header</td><td>Exchange &#x26; Stock Autocomplete Fields</td><td>Success</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Info</td><td>Information Page</td><td>Success</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>History</td><td>Stock History</td><td>Success</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Analysis</td><td>Linear Regression Results &#x26; Chart</td><td>Partial Success</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Auto Analysis</td><td>Auto Analysis Functionality</td><td>Success</td></tr></tbody></table>

It is difficult to tie an aim like 'Easy to Learn' down to a specific feature. The Linear nature of the design helps   Search for Stock -> See Info -> Analyse Parameters -> Auto Analyse definitely helps.

Lots of Help text, like seen on the Analysis and Auto Analysis page also help.&#x20;

If I go back to the Usability testing
