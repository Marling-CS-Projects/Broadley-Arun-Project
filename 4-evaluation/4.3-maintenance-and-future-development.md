# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of the Project

* **Analysis Methods**

One of the things I had wanted to do at the beginning of the project was implement multiple analysis methods. This would be relatively easy to do as the library I chose implemented a number:

Polynomial Regression: Fitting a curve through the data.

Multivariate Regression: Making the linear regression from multiple parameters not just the one.

Random Forest Regression: Basically AI&#x20;

Machine Learning Methods.

Unfortunately I just simply ran out of time, using these methods would have required me to create a lot more User Interface components. This would have made the results much more interesting and would have made finding correlations for a stock easier.

* **Finding Correlations**

The user currently has to select a stock and then investigate to find correlations himself. This is time-consuming for the user and open to them giving up in exasperation. The Auto-Analysis feature was built to try to help with this issue, but it still doesn't go far enough as the User still has to select the stock they want to analyse.

* **Data Provider**

The data provider, EOD , that I decided to use turned out to not be so good. Whilst they had information on 60 exchanges with 1000's of stocks on those exchanges,  some of the more useful data sets were only provided inconsistently.

[Insider Dealing ](https://mobitech-sheffield.co.uk/): Only provided for US stock markets, provided inconsistently for London stock markets and not at all for most others.

[Sentiment and News Story feeds:](https://mobitech-sheffield.co.uk/)  Mostly on US stocks, and very inconsistently for other markets.

I felt that they hid this from me until I had actually subscribed to their data service.
