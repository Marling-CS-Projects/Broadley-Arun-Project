Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

### User Feedback

### Question 1:

The question of "did my website crash" went pretty succesful. Onlly 1/10 people had this problem and in his case this was a problem with my laptop not the website so can be ignored. This shows basically my website does mot crash and there are no problems to fix around this topic.

### Question 2:

In this and the following questions i used a system where the users would rank from 1(lowest) to 5(highest) how easy or hard different tasks where. Using the dropdown boxes was obviously very easy as everyone rated it a 5 which reinforces how good the components from material design are.

### Question 3:

This question asks how easy was it to understand the data presented in the 'history' tab. This section has alot of numbers and big words one must need to understand so i am pleasently suprised by how high the results for this question where. Mainly 4s and 5s with one 3 is a good result shows no further improvements are neccesary for this section.



### Question 4:
