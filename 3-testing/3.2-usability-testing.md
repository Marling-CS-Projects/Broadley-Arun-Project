Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

### User Feedback

### Question 1:

The question of "did my website crash" went pretty succesful. Onlly 1/10 people had this problem and in his case this was a problem with my laptop not the website so can be ignored. This shows basically my website does mot crash and there are no problems to fix around this topic.

### Question 2:

&#x20;  &#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (37).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

in this and the following questions i used a system where the users would rank from 1(lowest) to 5(highest) how easy or hard different tasks where. Using the dropdown boxes was obviously very easy as everyone rated it a 5 which reinforces how good the components from material design are.

### Question 3:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (38).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This question asks how easy was it to understand the data presented in the 'history' tab. This section has alot of numbers and big words one must need to understand so i am pleasently suprised by how high the results for this question where. Mainly 4s and 5s with one 3 is a good result shows no further improvements are neccesary for this section.



### Question 4:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (39).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



Very simmilar results as question 3, shows that no changes are neccesary to this section.



### Question 5:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (40).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Very simmilar to results from previous question, shows format of graph is adequate and no further changes are needed.



### Question 6:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (41).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The results in this section where suprisingly good, this section displayed different regression data which isnt the easiest to understand but i guess most of these people diagreed and thought it was easy.



### Question 7:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (42).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

These results are slightly worse then others but due to the complexity of this section coupled with the fact that these people arent interested in the topic so dont know anything these results acctualy seem quite positive.



### Question 8:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (43).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Results are simmilar to question 7 which seemed great to me so i dont see why and changes to this section would be neccesary.



### Question 9:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (44).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Not one person encountered a bug, perfect.



### Question 10:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (45).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Im sure someone had a typo, but other then that no changes needed.
