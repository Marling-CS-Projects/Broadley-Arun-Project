# 3.2 Usability Testing

## All Criterias To Assess

| Test                                | Test Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Efficient                       | I made a question to test the speed of my website when it came to switching tabs or loading data up. This topic was assesed in question 2.                                                                                        |
| 2 - Component testing               | I made questions to assess how well the function of my different components where to understand and how easy they where to use. This topic was assesed in questions 3,                                                            |
| 3 - Error tolerant                  | I made questions to assess how many errors in my website there where with the intention to fix them afterwards. In questions 1,9, 10 and 11. I prompted the user to tell me if they experienced any errors and what these where.  |
| 4 - Easy to Navigate And Understand | I made questions to assess how easy my website was to navigate and how practical the user interface was for a user to understand. This topic was assesed in questions 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9                                            |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

### User Feedback

### Question 1:



<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (26).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (49).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The question of "did my website crash" went pretty successful. Only 1/10 people had this problem and in his case this was a problem with my laptop not the website so can be ignored due to it being a complete anomaly. This shows basically my website does not crash and there are no problems to fix around this topic.



### Question 2:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (69).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In this and the following questions i used a system where the users would rank from 1(lowest) to 5(highest) how easy or hard different tasks where. This question was made to learn how well my website functioned when used by the testers and the results show the website performed quite well. All high results showing the website is working adequately.

### Question 3:

&#x20;  &#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (37).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (64).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

&#x20;Using the dropdown boxes was obviously very easy as every single person tested rated it a 5 which reinforces how good the components from material design are.

### Question 4:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (38).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (65).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This question asks how easy was it to understand the data presented in the 'history' tab. This section has a lot of numbers and big words one must need to understand so i am quite surprised by how high the results for this question where. Mainly 4s and 5s with one 3 is a good result shows no further improvements are necessary for this section.

### Question 5:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (39).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (60).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Very similar results as question 3, shows that no changes are necessary to this section.



### Question 6:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (40).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (58).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Very similar to results from previous question, shows format of graph is adequate and no further changes are needed.



### Question 7:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (41).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (57).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The results in this section where suprisingly good, this section displayed different regression data which isnt the easiest to understand but i guess most of these people diagreed and thought it was easy.



### Question 8:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (42).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (56).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

These results are slightly worse then others but due to the complexity of this section coupled with the fact that these people arent interested in the topic so dont know anything these results acctualy seem quite positive.



### Question 9:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (43).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (66).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Results are simmilar to question 7 which seemed great to me so i dont see why and changes to this section would be neccesary.



### Question 10:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (44).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Not one person encountered a bug, perfect.



### Question 11:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (45).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (67).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In this set of data all the results seem quite positive except "ollies" who seems to be an outlier, I did ask for detail but none was recieved im sure this was a mistake from the user.&#x20;
