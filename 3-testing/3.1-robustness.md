# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

As part of my testing process, I will do the following:

1. Test solution against the initial Success Criteria.
2. Then I will do ad hoc testing of each of the Components. This will involve rerunning the prior development test as well as doing some further ad hoc tests of the component.&#x20;

### **Success Criteria - User Interface**

<table><thead><tr><th width="61">Ref. No.</th><th width="260">Criterion</th><th width="212">Justification</th><th>Test</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Application has Drop down box allowing the user to select Stock to analyse</td><td>This is a necessary feature to allow the whole application to work</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Application has page allowing you to see basic information of the stock selected. Its History etc.</td><td>This page will allow the user to get some information on the stock before seeing the analysis</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>My application has analysis page showing results of regression testing. Plus graphs of our forecast.</td><td>This is the result page</td><td><strong>Pass</strong></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>My application shows the results of the linear regression Model. On whether I should or should not buy this stock.</td><td>This is the results page</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Application has some way of doing an auto anaylsis to see which fields have most correlation to growth.</td><td>This is the AutoAnalysis Page.</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### API

The success criteria for the backend server component.

<table><thead><tr><th width="68">Ref. No.</th><th width="218">Criterion</th><th width="261">Justification</th><th>Test</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>I will need to create a  server with an API to allow my front end to work. Most of these API's will just simply give me back data from EODHistoricalData.com.</td><td>This will be required to make the system work.</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>API : Stock Info for Search box</td><td>I will need an API that I can call that will return data for my search box. The drop-down search box needs to be clever enough so that when the user types in 'AAPL' it can give the user options that contain AAPL. (Apple.</td><td><p>Pass with Changes</p><p></p><p>This was implemented differently. There are two dropdowns, one to specify the exchange then one to specify stock. This was due, to the large number of stocks. This required the API to be split into 2. One for Exhanges and one for stocks within an echange.</p><p></p></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>API : Detailed Stock Info</td><td>I will need to create an API that when given the stock ticker from the search above gathers together the required data for the Info Page and for any analysis required.</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>API : Analysis Info</td><td>I will need to create an API that when given the stock ticker from the search above gathers together the required analysis data that can then be used to populate the analysis page.</td><td>Pass.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>



### Analysis Results

Overall analysis results are valid, showing all the linear regression results (See evidence). One thing that was complicated to validate was the system prediction being more accurate than random chance. It really depends on which stock you select. For Instance, Apple's correlation between the Date and Closing price is very high but for other parameters, it's quite low.

<table><thead><tr><th width="103">Ref. No.</th><th width="253">Criterion</th><th width="243">Justification</th><th>Test</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>System will produce regression performance indicators that need to be calculated correctly.</td><td>We need these performance indicators to forecast.</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>linear regression Model output needs to be clear enough for a user to interpret whether to buy or sell stocks.</td><td>Lots of linear regression  models produce output that is not understandable by people who do not have needed knowledge. Our output needs to be simpler.</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>System predictions must be more accurate than random chance over the last month of data.</td><td>This is the core requirement of the system.</td><td><p>Fail/Pass. </p><p></p><p>This is very dependent on stock chosen for analysis</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Non-functional

Most of my non-functional requirements passed. One though was adding a legal disclaimer which I forgot when doing the initial development. I have now added this in a new footer component to the application and the documentation.&#x20;

Another one that was more of a problem was localization of number formats. This seems quite difficult to do. I could not find a way of reading the local PC's number format from javascript. Other solutions like Google Docs don't seem to do it either.

<table><thead><tr><th width="76">Ref. No.</th><th width="141">Criterion</th><th width="348">Justification</th><th>Test</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Compatibility</td><td>UI must be compatible with the major browsers used. Chrome:64.9%, Safari is 19.5% with Edge: 4.6%  </td><td>Pass - See Evidence</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Reliability</td><td>User Interface needs to be reliable and consistently work. Our target market is based around Retail investors who may not be too IT Literate.</td><td><p>Pass</p><p>See Usability Testing section</p></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Localisation</td><td>Front-end application needs to work in UK, EUROPE &#x26; the US. We will need to test things like number formats. We will not translate the front end into different languages.</td><td>Fail - This is more difficult to do than I thought. basically there seems to get the PC's regional settings into the browser in Javascript.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Legislation</td><td>Offering advice from a legal viewpoint is difficult. We will need to put in disclaimers. Ensuring the user does not use our forecast in his decision-making.</td><td>Fail - No disclaimer</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Retest</td><td>Added disclaimer to Footer component</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Performance</td><td>the frontend UI needs to be performant. Apparently, a good metric is to say that the User should not have to wait more than 2 seconds for any action. The only actions that may take longer than this are the calculation actions where we warn the user it might take a long time to run.</td><td>Pass with single issue, Auto analysis section takes long er to calculate than 2 seconds. I think this is okay.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Scalabilty</td><td>I will setup the system to work with a minimum of 2 users at any time. These are called concurrent users.</td><td>Pass - See Evidence</td></tr></tbody></table>
