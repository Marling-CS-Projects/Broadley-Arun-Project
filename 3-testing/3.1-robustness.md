# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

As part of my testing process, I will do the following:

1. Test solution against the Success Criteria.
2. Test the prior tested development tests. To ensure the fixes still work.
3. Then I will do ad hoc testing of each of the Components.

### **Success Criteria - User Interface**
