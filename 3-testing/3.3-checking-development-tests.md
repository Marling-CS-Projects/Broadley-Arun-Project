# 3.3 Adhoc Testing

I've decided to do ad-hoc testing across each of the components. I should manage to pick up most defects if I do this.  I will log each defect with the status Fail. and then move it to **Defered** for defects I've decided not to fix or **Fixed** for the defect I have fixed.

## Tests



<table><thead><tr><th width="106">Component</th><th width="208">How to reproduce bug</th><th width="196">What I expect</th><th>Status</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Header</td><td>Go to the search stocks or exchanges dropdown box and try type a stock in. 5 second delay from when you can click on your stock and when you type the name of that stock.</td><td>For the delay to be 2 or less seconds</td><td>Defferred - This issue is not too serious as the user can still type the name of the stock whilst waiting for the dropdown . Its caused because it can sometimes take 5 secs o download all the stock names for an exchange</td></tr><tr><td>Info</td><td>Click get info after choosing and exchange and stock, read the information section and the exchange box is empty</td><td>The exchange box to say the exchange you can find the stock at.</td><td>Fixed</td></tr><tr><td>Table</td><td>After clicking get info in the history section the sentiment section is broken. Sentiment is supposed to be between -1 and 1 but there are data points like 20 and -449</td><td>For all values for sentiment to be -1 to 1.</td><td>Fixed</td></tr><tr><td>Header</td><td>Look at top of screen. Black box that says "stock predictor" doesn't fit the screen its a bit to small.</td><td>Be long enough to fit whole screen</td><td>Fixed</td></tr><tr><td>Graph</td><td>Look to left of graph in analysis section. Definition of Chi^2 is "the goodness of fit" definition of goodness does not fit at all with what I'm trying to say</td><td>make the definition make sense</td><td>Fixed</td></tr><tr><td>Graph</td><td>Apple stock, analysis section x select being "volume" y being "closing price" timing "day". The line of best fit does not fit the graph at all.</td><td>Line of best fit should fit graph</td><td>Not a Defect. I've just realised the Line of best fit is the 'average' line so can sometimes not fit the graph.</td></tr><tr><td>Graph</td><td>Click "calculate" and trying to hover over the line of best fit is quite difficult. It forces me to click on the two furthest edge data points which are quite hard to click when they are in a cluster of other data points.</td><td>Have a perimeter around the line which if your cursor goes over you find regression line value. </td><td>Defered : Difficult to fix and its possible to use.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
