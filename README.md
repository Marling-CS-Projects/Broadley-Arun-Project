# 1.1 Problem Identification

For an investor stock market prices seem to move randomly, which makes it difficult to invest successfully. I would like to investigate how best to predict these stock market movements. This would allow me to invest with more accuracy and precision than I am currently able to do so. I would like to use simple numerical methods like regression analysis which I have learned about in my Maths A-Level class to predict future stock prices. This will involve me looking at the performance of specific financial instruments against some key inputs for instance trading volume, the time period, newsfeed positivity against future growth.

A problem like this should be solvable by computational methods like Linear Regression Analysis working out which input affects the result (the stock price) the most using historical data. I also if possible want to try an AI approach, though this might be difficult in the time allowed.

The History and Development of AI

The origins of AI can be found back in the 1950s when mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing brought forward the idea of machines almost simulating human intelligence which was an idea with unlimited potential. In the years that followed, AI witnessed significant advancements, with the development of rule-based systems and knowledge-based systems, these are both ways to interpret information. Recent years have seen a surge in AI's capabilities. This is due to advances in computational power and the emergence of deep learning techniques. It has also become much easier to implement, in the past it was very complex to do, now in theory there are many libraries that will hide the complexity away from the developer.

Evolution of the AI Industry and Popular Uses

As AI evolved, it gradually affected tremendously various industries, transforming the way millions of people live and work. Some popular applications of AI include:

1. Online personal assistants, such as Siri and Alexa, use human language processing to understand and respond to user queries.
2. Image and speech recognition systems, which identify objects, people, and voices with remarkable accuracy.
3. Self-driving cars, where AI is used to make real-time decisions that have to be perfectly accurate to navigate across roads safely and efficiently.
4. Healthcare, where AI-powered diagnostic tools and personalized treatment plans are revolutionizing patient care.
5. Customer service, where AI chatbots assist in providing quick and efficient support to clients.

Linear Regression, though, is defined as 'a type of supervised machine learning.'&#x20;
