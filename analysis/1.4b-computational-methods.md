## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

###

Abstraction is a concept in computer programming that involves simplifying problems by removing unnecessary details and signaling out the essential variables. When using abstraction on a problem a developer can reduce his workload and have fewer defects due to creating a simpler idea. This approach enables programmers to create cleaner and more efficient code that can be easily built upon and modified.

### What information is relevant to solving a particular problem?

For the purpose of the problem, we are trying to solve. We are simplifying the thousands of different variables that describe a stock down into a much smaller number of variables that we will use when trying to forecast future stock prices. &#x20;

Relevant information for my idea of predicting the stock market using Linear Regression will include historical stock prices, trading volumes, the number of news reports, economic indicators, Director Purchases and Sales and any other market indications that I can source.&#x20;

### What computations need to be performed in order to solve this problem?

In order to create a Linear regression algorithm to predict the stock market a bunch of computations need to be performed.

Firstly we need to create a database of historical stock market data for the specific stock we are analysing. After bringing all the data into one section I must perform different calculations to find outliers and errors that I would not like to be a part of the database that I run the analysis on. This will for instance remove data from days when there is more that a 20% swing in value like the day of 9/11.  &#x20;

Next, linear regression analysis needs to be performed on the test data to identify any patterns and relationships between different parameters that may affect the stock prices. This involves calculating the coefficients of the linear regression model, this can be done in excel with a database.



### How can we be sure the problem has been solved?

This is an important question to answer. My main factor when it comes to proving the problem I intend to solve has been solved is the accuracy of my system at predicting future stock market movements. To assess the accuracy of my system's predictions, i can compare its predictions with the actual stock price in the future. I can do this by keeping a certain amount of historical data, for instance, the last 12 months, as test data that I can then use to evaluate my systems predictions.. If my system's predictions are at all correct or at least decent then i can say the problem has been solved to some degree. it's important to note that the predictions will quite definitely not be perfect as the stock market is a highly unpredictable system with many different forces that need to be taken into account of that i don't even have access to.&#x20;

The other concerning factor is that there are many players in the stock market, already doing this sort of thing.&#x20;



## Thinking Ahead

Thinking ahead is important for my idea, this is because the stock market is a very complex and volatile system with many unpredictable factors and variables that can change the performance of the market as a whole. My forecasting tool will have to predict the stock market so it is important to consider these various factors. the algorithm that will be used to analyse data and all the different limitation and biases that will exist in the data.

Also, it is important to consider the risks involved in making certain financial predictions where any unforeseen event could impact the accuracy of it's prediction. By thinking ahead and anticipating these risks I can try to develop strategies to mitigate this risk and create a more reliable system.

## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

To apply procedural thinking and decomposition to my idea I would start by breaking down the problem I want to solve into smaller and smaller problems making them more achievable.

1. I would start by identifying relevant data sources, for example, I would use historical stock market data, financial news feeds and other sources of data to train my forecasting solution on.
2. Once I have collected all various data sources I would have to make sure all the data is suitable for analysis and then I would have to organise what I can use it for.
3. Once I have done that I would develop the Forecasting code itself. This would involve using regression analysis to analyze the data and generate predictions depending on different parameters.
4. Once the algorithm has been developed it will need to be tested to make sure it is making relatively accurate predictions. this involves back testing using historical data or comparing its predictions to real work market performance over time.

By breaking down the problem of predicting the stock market into smaller sub-problems using decomposition, and approaching each sub-problem using procedural thinking it is easier to find a solution and more efficient. this approach can help ensure that the problem is solved in a structured way leading to a more accurate and reliable prediction system.



## Thinking Logically



When building a Forecasting tool to predict the stock market thinking logically is essential to ensure that the system responds to changes in different parameters in a logical manner producing decent predictions. These are ways thinking logically can be applied to this task.

1. Defining what the problem is: This is the first step in building a forecasting tool to predict stock market movements, this involves identifying specific stocks or markets that I can test as test data. I would also define the level of accuracy that my forecasting tool will target.
2. Identifying the relevant data sources: Finding the appropriate data sources is the next stage. These include historical stock market data, financial news feeds, and other relevant economic indicators. Currently, I'm targeting using EODHistoricalData.com as my data provider.&#x20;
3. Data pre-processing and cleaning: Following the identification of the data sources, I will have to clean and pre-process the data to make it ready for analysis. To maintain consistency, this may include eliminating outliers and adding missing information for instance when a stock splits.

Thinking logically is crucial at each of these stages to make sure the forecast tool operates properly and produces accurate predictions. This will entail recognising the connections between various elements of the problem and figuring out how they interact with one another, as well as employing different tools and processes to solve the problem.

## Thinking Concurrently

Thinking concurrently would include developing a system that can process many streams of data  concurrently while also carrying out other tasks like analysing historical market trends, keeping an eye on news feeds for important information, and forecasting future market trends by using AI and a linear regression model to predict the stock market.

For instance, we could create an AI system that analyses the performance of individual stocks, industry trends, and macroeconomic data all at once while using  linear regression analysis on different parameters.&#x20;

Simultaneously, the system may also be reading multiple sources of information, such as news feeds and possibly social media platforms, to detect any market-influencing data. Through concurrent thinking, we can create a system that is capable of dealing with numerous tasks at the same time, enhancing its productivity and accuracy in forecasting stock market performance. As a result, this may lead to superior investment choices and better financial results.

An example of this will be when the user search for a specific stock for instance AAPL. (Apple). Once the user has selected Apple. Our backend will need to asynchronously (at the same time) download multiple data feeds using APIs, compile all that data info into a JSON feed, do the regression analysis and post the results to the front end. If we do that work concurrently we will reduce the user's wait time.
