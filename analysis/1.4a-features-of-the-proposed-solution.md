# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## 1.  User Interface

I have mocked up the user I would like to produce in Excel:

The User Interface is split into 3 separate components The Search box, The Info Section and the Analysis section. Each of these is described below as separate sections.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1).png>)    The Info & History pages.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1).png>)   The Analysis page.



### Feature 1 - Search Box

One of the main parts of the applications will be the stock selection Search Box.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1) (1).png>)

This box will allow the user to type in a company name or a stock ticker code (LLOY) for instance and then allow the user to select a stock from a drop-down list to make it easy for them to select a company. This will do a selection search and show the stocks that fit whats been typed in making it easier for the users to find what they are looking for.

## Limitations

### Limitation 1

Due to data availability and performance issues, I will limit the search list to UK stocks in the FTSE100 this will increase performance and limit the data requirements.

### Limitation 2

The user will only be able to select companies that have a significant amount of historical data and will not be able to select new companies that have just entered the FTSE100.

### Feature 2 - Viewing Info & Historical Stock data

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1) (1).png>)

Once the user has selected the company they wish to analyse the application will show some informtation about the company and the history of that company's stock price along with a number of parameters that may have affected the stock price. I will show the following data:

Date: The date of stock price.

Closing Price: the end price of the stock on that day.

Volume: Quantity of stock bought in the market that day

Season:  Winter, Summer, Spring, Autumn.&#x20;

Day of Week: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday

News Articles: Number of News Articles on that company that date.

Director Purchases: Number of shares purchased by directors that day.

Director Sells Number of shares sold by directors that day.

Stock Growth: amount the stock grew that day. (prior day close to current day close)

Stock Growth relative to market growth.



## Limitations

### Limitation 1

Depending on the grid I use, I may have to limit how many lines of history I can show the user. I'm not sure how much data grids can easily hold. There may also be a problem downloading all that data from the 3rd party data provider.

### Limitation 2

I may have to change some of the parameters I'm planning on using If I find it difficult getting the data. Currently I'm hoping to use [https://eodhistoricaldata.com/](https://eodhistoricaldata.com/) as they have a free API key and test account but I've not yet tried to use their API's.

### Specific Feature 3 - Analysis interface

The analysis interface will be the environment where the user will conduct their analysis. First the user will type into a textbox the name of the stock they want my algorithm to perform regression analysis on. Then they will select the single parameter they want to compare to stock growth. Then they will click a button that says "calculate" and this data will be shown on a graph with 2 lines being the changes in the parameters and a line of best fit between the two. With this a set of data will be outputted in a textbox and this will be the results of the regression analysis. This data will contain:&#x20;

1. Multiple R: This is the coefficient that shows correlation. It shows you how strong the linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables is. A value of 1 means a perfect positive relationship and 0 means no relationship.
2. R squared: R^2 shows determination meaning it tells you how many points on the graph overlap with the regression line. If r^2 = 90 this would mean that 90% of the variation of the dependent variable around the mean is explained and correlated by the x-values.&#x20;
3. Standard error of regression: This represents the average distance that the values fall from the regression line. It basically tells you how wrong the regression model is on average using the values of the independent variable
4. Observations: Number of observations in the sample.

## Limitations

### Limitation 1

1. The timespan of my graph will be limited to 5 years and it won't be updateable by the user to choose a longer or shorter timespan due to simplifying the user interface.
2. The amount of parameters that you can compare to the stock growth at once is limited to 1. This is due to the complexity of analyzing multiple parameters at the same time compared to how much the user will gain from this being implemented which would be a very small amount of time.

## Broad Category 2 - Calculations

The application will have 2 ways of forecasting the future growth of the selected stock.

1. Linear Regression: I will calculate the correlation between a specifically selected parameter and the future growth of the stock.
2.

### Specific Feature 1 - Linear Regression Calculations

Once the user has selected the parameter he wishes to run a linear regression on I will calculate the following Linear Regression coefficients

1. R-Squared - How close the selected parameter fits the Growth parameter we want to use. The answer ranges from 0: No Fit, to 1: fits exactly.
2. P-Value - Larger values show less fit lower values show more fit.
3. F & F-DN describes the shape of the best-fit line

The calculations above will show the correlations between the selected variable and the stock growth. I plan on trying to fit the growth to the growth of the stock in the following week from the date of the actual data.

The user will be able to select the following fields to run the prediction on:

* Volume: Quantity of stock bought in the market that day
* Season:  Winter, Summer, Spring, Autumn.&#x20;
* Day of Week: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
* News Articles: Number of News Articles on that company that date.
* Director share transactions: Number of shares bought and sold by directors that day.
* Stock Growth: the amount the stock grew that day. (prior day close to current day close)

### &#x20;Limitation 1

There are many parameters to the test that we could use. I have chosen the ones I described as they are simpler to get.&#x20;

My linear regression analysis models will have a couple of limits; one being the amount of historical data that will be fed into the linear regression analysis to produce a value. This should be limited for performance reasons as too much data will cause poor performance and a worse user experience with little gain. I am limiting my parameters to: The day of the week, season, the volume of stock traded, the number of news articles and director trading. I chose these parameters as they seem like the ones that as individuals can bring the most gain for the users, also getting information for these parameters is a lot more possible than others.

### Limitation 2:

running the linear regression comparisons, it would be good to run them against different output growth sets, for instance, the following week's growth, or the growth the next day. To reduce complexity, though, I will only run the comparisons against the following week's growth. &#x20;

### Specific Feature 2 - AI Calculations

As part of the Analysis feature, we will also have a calculation that shows the positivity of my linear regression model predicting the possibility that the stock will grow in the following period. This positivity will be shown as a %, with 100% showing that our model is relatively sure that the stock will grow in the next period. &#x20;

## Limitations

### Limitation 1

Description of a limitation, due to scope/time constraints or difficulty of implementation.

### **Market Data**&#x20;

My main problems with this project and how to possibly solve them:

1. Acquiring needed skills and knowledge: I lack the required knowledge in finance, artificial intelligence, and the creation of a user interface at this moment to do this project successfully. I am going to need to dedicate a lot of xtime to learning relevant information and analyzing existing research and models. Specifically i will use website like yahoofinance.com to obtain large datasets of past financial data. With this data i will take the stock price and perform regression analysis to compare the stock price to other variables, for example days of the week or volume traded.&#x20;
2. Access to quality data:  Obtaining historical data of for example past stock prices aren't always public stopping me from using them. I will have to limit myself to investigating open-source  data sources. Although this isnt perfect its fine, there are plenty of websites with more then enough data for me to use.
3. Finding and being accurate with reasons of changes in market: Numerous factors influence financial markets, resulting in constantly changing and messy data. The newsfeeds I will use won't always contain the reasons for a change in stock price. This problem doesn't really have a practical fix but isn't so much a problem. The linear regression model should still be able to predict better then an average human and can be used as a guide. So my model wont be perfect but it will be helpful which will be made clear.
4. Accounting for unforeseeable market events: Financial markets can be impacted by unexpected events like natural disasters or extreme political changes that are borderline impossible for any model to be able to be predict.  I need to also use external data sources for example  social media posts explaining these changes and use models capable of handling uncertainty, such as Bayesian models or reinforcement learning. This will be the most difficult bit but i will try my best to make the model as best fit as possible.
5. Ethical considerations:  Using linear regression models to predict stock market trends will bring up ethical concerns, like market manipulation or insider trading.  I need to be mindful of these issues and adhere to ethical guidelines and legal regulations when researching and applying these models in finance. although this should not be an issue its good to be completely aware of the rules around the project you are trying to do.

By combining the use of technical skills, refining the model, utilizing suitable data sources and maintaining an ethical approach these challenges can be addressed. Trying to get info or feedback from professionals/highly skilled people could also be helpful, this can be done by watching certain youtube videos of people doing the same idea as me or trying to contact a specific person who could possibly be interested in helping for some reason.

### Technical Research

Angular and Javascript/Typescript

Angular comes with a framework that makes building apps simpler.



#### Components I will need :(For angular)

My solution will need components to make up the user interface, they will be compatible with Angular. These components will be:

1. Graphing component: This will be used to show line graphs of stock history against other parameter for example seasons, what day of the week it is etc.
2. Text component: to have the ability to display text on the user interface
3. Grid component: To show the downloaded stock market data which i would perform regression analysis on to find a correlation between different variables.
4. Dropdown box component: this will be used to allow users to select stock they want to perform analysis on

Investigate material design and see what it can provide, Do this in next week or so: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5E2AVpwsko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5E2AVpwsko)

API's to get the Stock market Data.
