  These are the success criteria for the project as a whole. I have broken them
  down into those that define the User Interface, the API's that I need to
  create and the Analysis results.

# 1.5 Success Criteria

### User Interface

| Ref. No. | Criterion                                                                                            | Justification                                                                                 | Reference                                                                                                    |

| 1        | Application has Drop down box allowing the user to select Stock to analyse                           | <ul><li>This is a necessary feature to allow the whole application to work</li></ul>          | [SearchBox ](../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#feature-1-search-box)                     |
| 2        | Application has page allowing you to see basic information of the stock selected. Its History etc.   | This page will allow the user to get some information on the stock before seeing the analysis | [Info Page](../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#feature-2-viewing-historical-stock-data)   |
| 3        | My application has analysis page showing results of regression testing. Plus graphs of our forecast. | This is the result page                                                                       | [Analysis Page](../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#specific-feature-3-analysis-interface) |
| 4        | My application shows the results of the AI Model. On whether I should or should not buy this stock.  | This is the results page                                                                      | [Analysis Page](../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#specific-feature-3-analysis-interface) |

Give my stakeholders it will be important that the User Interface is simple
and straightforward to use.                                                                 |

### Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.

| Ref. No. | Criterion     | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Reference                                                  |

| 1        | Compatibility | UI must be compatibile with the major browsers used. Chrome:64.9% , Safari is 19.5% with Edge: 4.6%                                                                                                                                                                           | [https://gs.statcounter.com/](https://gs.statcounter.com/) |

| 3        | Reliability   | User Interface needs to be reliable and consistently work. Our target market is based around Retail Investerors who may not by too IT Literate.                                                                                                                               | Stakeholder section.                                       |
| 4        | Localisation  | Front end application need to work in UK, EUROPE & the US. We will need to test things like number formats. We will not translate the Frontend into different languages.                                                                                                      |                                                            |
| 5        | Legislation   | Offering advice from a legal viewpoint is difficult. We will need to put in lots of disclaimers. Ensuring the user does not use our forecast in his decision making.                                                                                                          |                                                            |
| 6        | Performance   | the frontend UI needs to be performant. Apparently, a good metric is to say that Use should not have to wait more than 2 seconds for any action. The only actions that may take longer than this are the calculation actions where we warn the user it might take a long time |                                                            |
| 7        | Scalabilty    | I will setup the system to work with a minimum of 2 users at any time. These are called concurrent users.                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                            |
