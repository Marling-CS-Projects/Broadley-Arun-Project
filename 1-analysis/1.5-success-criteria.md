  These are the success criteria for the project as a whole. I have broken them
  down into those that define the User Interface, the API's that I need to
  create and the Analysis results.

# 1.5 Success Criteria

### User Interface

<table><thead><tr><th width="154">Ref. No.</th><th>Criterion</th><th>Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Application has Drop down box allowing the user to select Stock to analyse</td><td><ul><li>This is a necessary feature to allow the whole application to work</li></ul></td><td><a href="../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#feature-1-search-box">SearchBox </a></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Application has page allowing you to see basic information of the stock selected. Its History etc.</td><td>This page will allow the user to get some information on the stock before seeing the analysis</td><td><a href="../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#feature-2-viewing-historical-stock-data">Info Page</a></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>My application has analysis page showing results of regression testing. Plus graphs of our forecast.</td><td>This is the result page</td><td><a href="../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#specific-feature-3-analysis-interface">Analysis Page</a></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>My application shows the results of the AI Model. On whether I should or should not buy this stock.</td><td>This is the results page</td><td><a href="../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#specific-feature-3-analysis-interface">Analysis Page</a></td></tr></tbody></table>



```
Give my stakeholders it will be important that the User Interface is simple
and straightforward to use.                                                                 |

### API

<table><thead><tr><th width="94">Ref. No.</th><th width="218">Criterion</th><th width="299">Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>I will need to create a  server with an API to allow my front end to work. Most of these API's will just simply give me back data from EODHistoricalData.com.</td><td>This will be required to make the system work.</td><td><a href="../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#feature-2-viewing-historical-stock-data">Info Page</a></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>API : Stock Info for Search box</td><td>I will need an API that I can call that will return data for my search box. The drop-down search box needs to be clever enough so that when the user types in 'AAPL' it can give the user options that contain AAPL. (Apple.</td><td><a href="../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#feature-1-search-box">SearchBox </a></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>API : Detailed Stock Info</td><td>I will need to create an API that when given the stock ticker from the search above gathers together the required data for the Info Page and for any analysis required.</td><td><a href="../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#feature-2-viewing-historical-stock-data">Info Page</a></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>API : Analysis Info</td><td>I will need to create an API that when given the stock ticker from the search above gathers together the required analysis data that can then be used to populate the analysis page.</td><td><a href="../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#specific-feature-3-analysis-interface">Analysis Page</a></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Analysis Results



<table><thead><tr><th width="154">Ref. No.</th><th width="253">Criterion</th><th>Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>System will produce regression performance indicators that need to be calculated correctly.</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>AI Model output needs to be clear enough for a user to interpret whether to buy or sell</td><td>Lots of AI models produce output that is not understandable by people who do not use AI. Our output needs to be simpler.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>System predictions must be more accurate than random chance over the last month of data.</td><td>This is the core requirement of the syste,</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.

<table><thead><tr><th width="104">Ref. No.</th><th width="165">Criterion</th><th width="399">Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Compatibility</td><td>UI must be compatibile with the major browsers used. Chrome:64.9% , Safari is 19.5% with Edge: 4.6%  </td><td><a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/">https://gs.statcounter.com/</a></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Reliability</td><td>User Interface needs to be reliable and consistently work. Our target market is based around Retail Investerors who may not by too IT Literate.</td><td>Stakeholder section.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Localisation</td><td>Front end application need to work in UK, EUROPE &#x26; the US. We will need to test things like number formats. We will not translate the Frontend into different languages.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Legislation</td><td>Offering advice from a legal viewpoint is difficult. We will need to put in lots of disclaimers. Ensuring the user does not use our forecast in his decision making.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Performance</td><td>the frontend UI needs to be performant. Apparently, a good metric is to say that Use should not have to wait more than 2 seconds for any action. The only actions that may take longer than this are the calculation actions where we warn the user it might take a long time</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Scalabilty</td><td>I will setup the system to work with a minimum of 2 users at any time. These are called concurrent users.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
