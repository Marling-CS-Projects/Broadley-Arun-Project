### Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.

| 23       | Reliability   | User Interface needs to be reliable and consistently work. Our target market is based around Retail Investerors who may not by too IT Literate.                                                                                                                               | Stakeholder section.                                       |
| 24       | Localisation  | Front end application need to work in UK, EUROPE & the US. We will need to test things like number formats. We will not translate the Frontend into different languages.                                                                                                      |                                                            |
| 25       | Legislation   | Offering advice from a legal viewpoint is difficult. We will need to put in lots of disclaimers. Ensuring the user does not use our forecast in his decision making.                                                                                                          |                                                            |
| 26       | Performance   | the frontend UI needs to be performant. Apparently, a good metric is to say that Use should not have to wait more than 2 seconds for any action. The only actions that may take longer than this are the calculation actions where we warn the user it might take a long time |                                                            |
| 27       | Scalabilty    | I will setup the system to work with a minimum of 2 users at any time. These are called concurrent users.                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                            |
