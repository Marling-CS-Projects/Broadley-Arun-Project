# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

### **Market Data**&#x20;

My main problems with this project and how to possibly solve them:

1. Acquiring needed skills and knowledge: I lack the required knowledge in finance, artificial intelligence, and creation of a user interface at this moment to do this project successfully. I am going to need to dedicate a lot of xtime to learning relevant information and analyzing existing research and models. Specifically i will use website like yahoofinance.com to obtain large datasets of past financial data. With this data i will take the stock price and perform regression analysis to compare the stock price to other variables, for example days of the week or volume traded. I can feed this information into my AI so it can predict off these facts.
2. Access to quality data:  Obtaining historical data of for example past stock prices aren't always public stopping me from using them. I will have to limit myself to investigating open-source  data sources. Although this isnt perfect its fine, there are plenty of websites with more then enough data for me to use.
3. Finding and being accurate with reasons of changes in market: Numerous factors influence financial markets, resulting in constantly changing and messy data. The newsfeeds I will use won't always contain the reasons for a change in stock price. This problem doesn't really have a practical fix but isn't so much a problem. The AI should still be able to predict better then an average human and can be used as a guide. So my AI wont be perfect but it will be helpful which will be made clear.
4. Accounting for unforeseeable market events: Financial markets can be impacted by unexpected events like natural disasters or extreme political changes that are borderline impossible for AI models to predict.  I need to also use external data sources for example  social media posts explaining these changes and use models capable of handling uncertainty, such as Bayesian models or reinforcement learning. This will be the most difficult bit but i will try my best to make the AI as best fit as possible.
5. Ethical considerations:  Using AI models to predict stock market trends will bring up ethical concerns, like market manipulation or insider trading.  I need to be mindful of these issues and adhere to ethical guidelines and legal regulations when researching and applying AI models in finance. although this should not be an issue its good to be completely aware of the rules around the project you are trying to do.

By combining the use of technical skills, refining the AI model, utilizing suitable data sources and maintaining an ethical approach these challenges can be addressed. Trying to get info or feedback from professionals/highly skilled people could also be helpful, this can be done by watching certain youtube videos of people doing the same idea as me or trying to contact a specific person who could possibly be interested in helping for some reason.

### Technical Research

Angular and Javascript/Typescript

Angular comes with a framework that makes building apps simpler.



#### Components I will need :(For angular)

My solution will need components to make up the user interface, they will be compatible with Angular. These components will be:

1. Graphing component: This will be used to show line graphs of stock history against other parameter for example seasons, what day of the week it is etc.
2. Text component: to have the ability to display text on the user interface
3. Grid component: To show the downloaded stock market data which i would perform regression analysis on to find a correlation between different variables.
4. Dropdown box component: this will be used to allow users to select stock they want to perform analysis on

Investigate material design and see what it can provide, Do this in next week or so: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5E2AVpwsko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5E2AVpwsko)

API's to get the Stock market Data.

## Broad Category 1 - User Interface

I have mocked up the user I would like to produce in Excel:

The user interface is split into 3 separate components The Search box, The History section and the Analysis section. These are described below in the feature sections

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)    The Historical page.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)   The Analysis page.



### Feature 1 - Search Box

One of the main parts of the applications will be the stock selection Search Box.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)

This box will allow the user to type in a company name or a stock ticker code (LLOY) for instance and then allow the user to select a stock from the search box.

## Limitations

### Limitation 1

Due to data availability issues and performance issues, I will limit the search list to UK stocks in the FTSE100 this will increase performance and limit the requirement for third-party data.

### Limitation 2

User will only be able to select companies that have a significant amount of historical data and will not be able to select new companies that have just entered the FTSE100.

### Feature 2 - Viewing Historical Stock data

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

Once the user has selected the company they wish to analyse the application will show the history of that company's stock price along with a number of parameters that may have affected the stock price. I will show the following data

Date: The date of stock price.

Closing Price: the end price of the stock on that day.

Volume: Quantity of stock bought in the market that day

Season:  Winter, Summer, Spring, Autumn.&#x20;

Day of Week: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday

News Articles: Number of News Articles on that company that date.

Director Purchases: Number of shares purchased by directors that day.

Director Sells Number of shares sold by directors that day.

Stock Growth: amount the stock grew that day. (prior day close to current day close)



## Limitations

### Limitation 1

Depending on the grid I use, I may have to limit how many lines of history I can show the user. I'm not sure how much data grids can hold. There may also be a problem downloading all that data from the 3rd party data provider.

### Limitation 2

I may have to change some of the parameters I'm planning on using If I find it difficult getting the data. Currently I'm hoping to use [https://eodhistoricaldata.com/](https://eodhistoricaldata.com/) as they have a free API key and test account but I've not yet tried to use their API's.

## Broad Category 2 - Calculations

The application will have 2 ways of forecasting the future growth of the selected stock.

1. Linear Regression: I will calculate the correlation between a specifically selected parameter and the future growth of the stock.
2. AI. Instead of using one parameter, I will train an AI Model on all of the parameters that we have in the historical sheet

### Specific Feature 1 - Linear Regression Calculations

Once the user has selected the parameter he wishes to run linear regression on I will calculate the following Linear Regression coefficients

1. R-Squared -&#x20;

My specific feature that I will use to find correlations between different variables in the stock market is a linear regression analysis method. This is an algorithm that will show how much a dependent variable and independent variable correlate as a percentage, this is known as the "p-value". This percentage describes how similar the movements in the two variables are. I will give the user large datasets on many different parameters for example day of the week, season, volume traded, number of news article and insider trading. These datasets will be used for the linear regression analysis and the user will have access to this historical data. The user using my user interface will choose 1 parameter to compare to stock growth to and the regression analysis algorithm will output the demanded data.

## Limitations

### Limitation 1

Description of a limitation, due to scope/time constraints or difficulty of implementation.
