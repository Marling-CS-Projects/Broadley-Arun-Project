# 1.4b Computational Methods

## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

### •What information is relevant to solving a particular problem?

Relevant information for my idea of predicting the stock market using AI could include historical stock prices and trading volumes, news reports, economic indicators, financial statements and reports and many other market dats sources. It may also be useful to use external factors such as political effects or natural disasters. These type of events have large effects on stock prices but are extremely hard if not almost impossible to predict so i will have to get my ai to instead of trying to predict these events, react to them effectively when they happen.

2. What computations need to be performed in order to solve the problem?
