## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

###

Abstraction is a concept in computer programming that involves simplifying problems by removing unnecessary details and singalling out the essential variables. When using abstraction on a problem a developer can reduce workload and have less defects due to more well planned out idea. This approach enables programmers to create cleaner and more efficient code that can be easily built upon and modified.

### What information is relevant to solving a particular problem?

Relevant information for my idea of predicting the stock market using AI could include historical stock prices and trading volumes, news reports, economic indicators, financial statements and reports and many other market dats sources. It may also be useful to use external factors such as political effects or natural disasters. These type of events have large effects on stock prices but are extremely hard if not almost impossible to predict so i will have to get my ai to instead of trying to predict these events, react to them effectively when they happen.



### What computations need to be performed in order to solve this problem?



in order to create an AI system to predict the stock market using linear regression analysis a bunch of computations need to be performed.



Firstly a dataset of historical stock market prices needs to be gathered. After gathering the data i must perform calculations to find outliers, errors and anomalies that i would not like to be a part of my calculations. I will also need to format the data in excel to make it suitable for analysis. I must also make decisions on which part of my data i should use as training data for my AI.

Next, linear regression analysis needs to be performed on the training data to identify any underlying patterns and relationships between different factors that may affect the stock prices. This involves calculating the coefficients of the linear regression model, which can be done using techniques such as Ordinary Least Squares or Gradient Descent.

Secondly linear regression analysis must be performed and tested on data that isn't used for testing the ai to identify patterns and relationships between different parameters with the growth of the stock. This involves calculating the coefficients of the linear regression model, which can be done using mathematical techniques.

### How can we be sure the problem has been solved?

This is an important question to answer. My main factor when it comes to proving the problem i intend to solve has been solved is the accuracy of my system at predicting the stock market. To assess the accuracy of my systems predictions, i can compare its predictions with the actual stock price of the future. I can do this by keeping a certain amount of historical data as test data and then i can evaluate my systems predictions of this test set. If my systems predictions are at all correct or at least decent then i can say the problem has been solved to some degree. its important to note that the predictions of the ai will not be perfect as the stock market is a highly unpredictable system with many different forces that need to be taken account for that i dont have access to. With this i need to understand my models limitations and potentiol and evaluate its performance based on these factors.
