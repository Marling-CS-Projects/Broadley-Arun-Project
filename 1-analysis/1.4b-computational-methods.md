## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

###

Abstraction is a concept in computer programming that involves simplifying problems by removing unnecessary details and signaling out the essential variables. When using abstraction on a problem a developer can reduce his workload and have fewer defects due to creating a simpler idea. This approach enables programmers to create cleaner and more efficient code that can be easily built upon and modified.

### What information is relevant to solving a particular problem?

For the purpose of the problem, we are trying to solve. We are simplifying the thousands of different variables that describe a stock down into a much smaller number of variables that we will use when trying to forecast future stock prices. &#x20;

Relevant information for my idea of predicting the stock market using Linear Regression or AI will include historical stock prices, trading volumes, the number of news reports, economic indicators, Director Purchases and Sales and any other market indications that I can source.&#x20;

### What computations need to be performed in order to solve this problem?

in order to create a Linear regression algorithm or AI system to predict the stock market using a bunch of computations need to be performed.

Firstly we need to create a dataset of historical stock market data for the specific stock we are analysing. After gathering the data I must perform calculations to find outliers, errors and anomalies that I would not like to be a part of the dataset that I run the analysis on. This will for instance remove data from days when there is more that a 20% swing in value, for instance 9/11.   I must also make decisions on which part of my data I should use as training data for my AI.

Next, linear regression analysis needs to be performed on the training data to identify any underlying patterns and relationships between different factors that may affect the stock prices. This involves calculating the coefficients of the linear regression model, which can be done using techniques such as Ordinary Least Squares or Gradient Descent.

After this I will use all the parameters I used individually in the linear regression analysis to train an AI model.

### How can we be sure the problem has been solved?

This is an important question to answer. My main factor when it comes to proving the problem I intend to solve has been solved is the accuracy of my system at predicting future stock market movements. To assess the accuracy of my system's predictions, i can compare its predictions with the actual stock price in the future. I can do this by keeping a certain amount of historical data, for instance, the last 12 months, as test data that I can then use to evaluate my systems predictions.. If my system's predictions are at all correct or at least decent then i can say the problem has been solved to some degree. it's important to note that the predictions will quite definitely not be perfect as the stock market is a highly unpredictable system with many different forces that need to be taken into account of that i don't even have access to.&#x20;

The other concerning factor is that there are many players in the stock market, already doing this sort of thing.&#x20;



## Thinking Ahead

Thinking ahead is important for my idea, this is because the stock market is a very complex and volatile system with many unpredictable factors and variables that can change the performance of the market as a whole. My forecasting tool will have to predict the stock market so it is important to consider these various factors like the type and quality of data that I will use to train the AI system, the algorithm that will be used to analyse data and all the different limitation and biases that will exist in the data.

Also, it is important to consider the risks involved in making certain financial predictions where any unforeseen event could impact the accuracy of it's prediction. By thinking ahead and anticipating these risks I can try to develop strategies to mitigate this risk and create a more reliable system.

## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

To apply procedural thinking and decomposition to my idea I would start by breaking down the problem I want to solve into smaller and smaller problems making them more achievable.

1. I would start by identifying relevant data sources, for example, I would use historical stock market data, financial news feeds and other sources of data to train my forecasting solution on.
2. Once I have collected all various data sources I would have to make sure all the data is suitable for analysis and then I would have to organise what I can use it for.
3. Once I have done that I would develop the Forecasting code itself. This would involve using regression analysis to analyze the data and generate predictions depending on different parameters and feeding the corrected data into an OpenAI to create an AI Model I could then use for forecasting.
4. Once the algorithm has been developed it will nned to be tested to make sure it is making relatively accurate predictions. this involves backtesting using historical data or comparing its predictions to real work market performance over time.

By breaking down the problem of predicting the stock market into smaller sub-problems using decomposition, and approaching each sub-problem using procedural thinking it is easier to find a solution and more efficient. this approach can help ensure that the problem is solved in a structured way leading to a more accurate and reliable prediction system.



## Thinking Logically



When building an AI to predict the stock market thinking logically is essential to ensure that the ai responds to changes in different parameters in a logical manner producing decent predictions. These are ways thinking logically can be applied to this task.

1. Defining what the problem is: This is the first step in building an AI to predict the stock market, this would involve identifying specific stocks or markets that i can test as test data. I would also define the level of accuracy that my ai will run on.
2. Identifying the relevant data sources: Finding the appropriate data sources is the next stage. These include historical stock market data, financial news feeds, and other relevant economic indicators.
3. Data pre-processing and cleaning: Following the identification of the data sources, the data must be cleaned and pre-processed to make it ready for analysis. To maintain consistency, this may include eliminating duplicates and adding missing information.
4. Developing the AI algorithm: This would include developing the ai itself using different machine learning techniques including regressing analysis which i would use to test historical data and find key information that will show the relationship between stock growth and various parameters.
5. Testing and improving the AI: After the AI algorithm has been created, it must be put to the test and improved to make sure it is producing reliable predictions. This may include running the system through a backtest using old data or contrasting its forecasts with actual market performance over time.

Thinking logically is crucial at each of these stages to make sure the AI operates properly and produces accurate predictions. This could entail recognising the connections between various elements of the problem and figuring out how they interact with one another, as well as employing different tools and processes to solve the problem.



## Thinking Concurrently

Thinking concurrently would include developing a system that can process many streams of data  concurrently while also carrying out other tasks like analysing historical market trends, keeping an eye on news feeds for important information, and forecasting future market trends by using  AI and a linear regression model to predict the stock market.

For instance, we could create an AI system that analyses the performance of individual stocks, industry trends, and macroeconomic data all at once while using  linear regression analysis on different parameters.&#x20;

Simultaneously, the system may also be reading multiple sources of information, such as news feeds and possibly social media platforms, to detect any market-influencing data. Through concurrent thinking, we can create a system that is capable of dealing with numerous tasks at the same time, enhancing its productivity and accuracy in forecasting stock market performance. As a result, this may lead to superior investment choices and better financial results.
