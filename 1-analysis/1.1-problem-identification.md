# 1.1 Problem Identification

Artificial intelligence has come a long way since its discovery in the 1950s. From its early days to its current widespread applications, AI has revolutionized various industries, making it an almost essential part of modern society. This section will explore the history and development of AI, its popular uses, and the reasons behind its tremendous value. Furthermore, I will discuss how i will use AI in my project to attempt to predict certain areas of the stock market.

The History and Development of AI

The origins of AI can be found back in the 1950s when mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing brought forward the idea of machines almost simulating human intelligence which was an idea with unlimited potential. In the years that followed, AI witnessed significant advancements, with the development of rule-based systems and knowledge-based systems, these are both ways to interpret information. The recent years have seen a surge in AI's capabilities. This is due to advances in computational power and the emergence of deep learning techniques.

Evolution of the AI Industry and Popular Uses

As AI evolved, it gradually effected tremendously various industries, transforming the way millions of people live and work. Some popular applications of AI include:

1. Online personal assistants, such as Siri and Alexa, who use human language processing to understand and respond to user queries.
2. Image and speech recognition systems, which identify objects, people, and voices with remarkable accuracy.
3. Self-driving cars, where AI is used to make real time decisions that have to be perfectly accurate to navigate across roads safely and efficiently.
4. Healthcare, where AI-powered diagnostic tools and personalized treatment plans are revolutionizing patient care.
5. Customer service, where AI chatbots assist in providing quick and efficient support to clients.

The Value of AI

AI's ability to process vast amounts of data at an extremely high speed and learn from it makes it a highly valuable tool for solving very hard problems and automating many different tasks. Its adaptability and continuous improvement allow it to provide solutions that are often more accurate and efficient than human-driven alternatives. Furthermore, AI can operate tirelessly, enabling businesses to scale their operations and improve productivity.
