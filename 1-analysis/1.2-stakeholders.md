# 1.2 Stakeholders

The stakeholders for my service would include:

1. Retail investors: These are the individuals who invest in stocks and shares and make investment decisions. Finder.com, a website that focuses on Financial Services, ran a survey in 2023 that found that 18% of people in the UK invest in stocks and shares. with 3.5 million subscribers to stocks and shares Isa's.
2. Regulators: Government agencies may be interested in overseeing the service to ensure that it operates in compliance with any relevant regulations.
3. Competitors: Other companies that provide similar services may be interested in the development and success of the system.
4. Data providers: The linear regression system will rely on data feeds from external sources, such as news outlets and stock exchanges which will also be stakeholders.

### Customer Role

What is universal for all stakeholders is this idea should help them all in some sort of way like:

1. Improved decision-making: Investors will be able to make better-informed decisions about when to buy, sell, or hold stocks, leading to more efficient portfolio management and improved returns on investment.
2. Risk management: Predictions made by linear regression analysis can help investors find potential risks and opportunities in the market, enabling them to better manage their risk exposure and maintain a well-balanced portfolio.
3. Increased market efficiency: Accurate stock market predictions can contribute to overall market efficiency, as investors make more informed decisions, this will reduce discrepancies in the market.
4. Cost savings: By helping to automate the research and analysis process, linear regression-driven stock market prediction tools can save time and reduce costs for both individual investors and platforms.

It's important for me to remember that predicting the stock market is an incredibly complex task, and no system can guarantee perfect predictions let alone one I produce. There are always uncertainties and factors that cannot be accurately predicted or accounted for. Nonetheless, a system could provide valuable insights and support decision-making for various stakeholders.  It will be important to clearly show this risk in the application's user interface.

## Demographics

The people who might be interested in our application will be those who invest in Stocks and shares. In the UK one of the first ways of doing this is through a "Stocks and Shares" ISA as it gives a bunch of tax advantages. The government provides these statistics every year at [https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/annual-savings-statistics-2022](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/annual-savings-statistics-2022)

This year it showed that in 2022 over 2.1m people in the UK had a stocks and shares ISA and that all those investments added up to some Â£33 billion pounds!

It also showed that the gender split was 57% male to 43% women and that the age distribution is:

| Age Range   | Number (K) | Percentage |
