# 1.2 Stakeholders

The stakeholders for my service that will predict the stock market using AI technology would include:

1. Customers or investors: These are the individuals or organizations who use the service to make investment decisions based on the predictions made by the AI technology.
2. Developers and engineers: These are the people responsible for creating and maintaining the AI system, including the algorithms, data inputs, and possible user interface.
3. Regulators: Government agencies may be interested in overseeing the service to ensure that it operates in compliance with any relevant regulations.
4. Shareholders: If the service is provided by a publicly-traded company, shareholders will have a  interest in the success of the service.
5. Competitors: Other companies that provide similar services may be interested in the development and success of the AI system.
6. Data providers: The AI system will rely on data feeds from many sources, such as  news outlets and stock exchanges.
7. Society as a whole: The accuracy and reliability of the AI system could have certain influences for the financial markets and the economy, making it effect  society as a whole in a minor way.

Whats universal for all stakeholders is this idea should help them all in some sort of way like:

1. Improved decision-making: Investors will be able to make better-informed decisions about when to buy, sell, or hold stocks, leading to more efficient portfolio management and improved returns on investment.
2. Risk management: AI controlled predictions can help investors find potential risks and opportunities in the market, enabling them to better manage their risk exposure and maintain a well-balanced portfolio.
3. Increased market efficiency: Accurate stock market predictions can contribute to overall market efficiency, as investors make more informed decisions, this will reduce discrepancies in the market.
4. Cost savings: By automating the research and analysis process, AI-driven stock market prediction tools can save time and reduce costs for both individual investors and financial institutions.

It's important for me to remember that  predicting the stock market is an incredibly complex task, and no AI system can guarantee perfect predictions. There are always uncertainties and factors that cannot be accurately predicted or accounted for. Nonetheless, an AI system could provide valuable insights and support decision-making for various stakeholders.
