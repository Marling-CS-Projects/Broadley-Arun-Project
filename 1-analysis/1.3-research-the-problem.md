## Competitors - Other websites that do this sort of thing

There are many websites that allow users to look at Stock Market information and do analysis on it. Many of the big ones are the platform ones where their clients buy and sell stocks, Hargreaves Landsowne, YouInvest (AJ Bell), Barclays etc. I don't really have access to those so I've looked at some of the more publicly accessible ones below. &#x20;

I could find lots of information about the history of stock movements. I didn't find many websites that did future predictions. At this stage I'm not sure if thats because they don't exist or I've just not found them.

### Fool - [www.fool.co.uk](https://www.fool.co.uk/)

This is a website with a number of journalists that talk about stock trading, why company's share prices should go up or down. It has lots of key data about stocks and shares in the UK. This website is a lot more informative for beginners then others with whole sections teaching people how to start investing and trying to guide new investors in the right direction.&#x20;

**Historical info on:**

* Share Price Quotes
* Volume -
* Dividends
* New-feeds
* Discussion groups in east stock.

### Yahoo Finance - [https://uk.finance.yahoo.com](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/?guccounter=1\&guce\_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8\&guce\_referrer\_sig=AQAAAJ\_EYCXolXW-t\_F8RkWXykU8FUHEEI1J-UQtkuPq1aKatDZfEsnZe7joMGE72xZz8TCYQMHmHkaRxfqFTspTxsieegdu43zXGMtUExG1KOKsvvva0dgp8bss\_ofSTxZb9Zbac5qw72zMS4vGHlgBW9RywTwgixq7O8i8iDD-0Lv6)

Seems very similar to the fool website with even more data!

* Share Price Quotes
* Volume
* Dividends
* Financials
* The analysis section shows Analysts' predictions on whether the stock will go up or down. Not sure who those analysts are though.
* Lots of statistics.
