# 1.3 Research

## Competitors - Other websites that do this sort of thing

There are many websites that allow users to look at Stock Market information and do analysis on it. Many of the really big ones are contained within the share purchasing platform where their clients buy and sell stocks, Hargreaves Lansdowne, YouInvest (AJ Bell), Barclays, etc.&#x20;

I don't really have access to those so I've looked at some of the more publicly accessible ones below. My conclusion to the exercise was that I found lots of websites that provided information. Far fewer provided any sort of forecasting facility.

I've looked in more detail at a few websites below:

### &#x20;Motley fool - www.fool.co.uk

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Motley fool - Stock View</p></figcaption></figure>

This is a website that has a number of journalists that talk about stock trading, and why companies' share prices should go up or down. It has lots of key data about stocks and shares in the UK. This website is a lot more informative for beginners than others with whole sections teaching people how to start investing and trying to guide new investors in the right direction.&#x20;

The website has lots of adverts for its own services, I guess this is how the site is paid for. This means that a lot of the really interesting recommendation information is hidden unless you subscribe to their services.

**Historical info on:**

* Share Price: This shows graphs of the share price for specific periods for instance last 5 years etc.
* Volume - The website shows the history of volume, which is the number of shares bought (and sold) on a specific day.
* Dividends - This shows each of the historical dividend payments for this stock. What amount the shareholder got per share and on what day it was announced and then paid.
* Articles - Websites have lots of blogs that will recommend (or not) a stock. These have lots and lots of detail and analysis on the stock. These are written by their journalists.&#x20;
* New feeds - market news feeds that show other articles or regulatory information about the company. Regulatory information is new that a company must stock. There are lots of these.&#x20;
* Discussion groups in each stock. Each stock has a page where users of the website can enter a comment or note on that stock. Sometimes the notes can be quite detailed and interesting. Sometimes they are just 'This stock is rubbish'.

### Yahoo Finance - [https://uk.finance.yahoo.com](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/?guccounter=1\&guce\_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8\&guce\_referrer\_sig=AQAAAJ\_EYCXolXW-t\_F8RkWXykU8FUHEEI1J-UQtkuPq1aKatDZfEsnZe7joMGE72xZz8TCYQMHmHkaRxfqFTspTxsieegdu43zXGMtUExG1KOKsvvva0dgp8bss\_ofSTxZb9Zbac5qw72zMS4vGHlgBW9RywTwgixq7O8i8iDD-0Lv6)

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Yahoo Finance has lots of information about not just stocks but about other financial instruments, for instance, Currency Trading, Crypto, Funds, etc. Seems to cover a much larger footprint than MotleyFool does. It also seems to have little self-generated content, hardly any articles, etc. Its News section seems to contain lots of articles written by other websites or organisations.

The website also has lots and lots of advertisements making it quite difficult to use.



Seems very similar to the fool website but with even more data!

* Share Price: This shows graphs of the share price for specific periods for instance last 5 years etc.
* Volume - The website shows the history of volume, which is the number of shares bought on a specific day.
* Dividends - This shows each of the historical dividend payments for this stock. What amount the shareholder got per share and on what day it was announced and then paid.
* Articles - Websites have lots of blogs that will recommend (or not) a stock. These have lots and lots of detail and analysis on the stock. These are written by their journalists.&#x20;
* New feeds - market news feeds that show other articles or regulatory information about the company. Regulatory information is new that a company must stock. There are lots of these.&#x20;
* Conversations - groups in each stock. Each stock has a page where users of the website can enter a comment or note on that stock. Sometimes the notes can be quite detailed and interesting. Sometimes they are just 'This stock is rubbish'.
* Stock Holders: This section shows how the major stockholders of this stock. For instance, we can see that, for example, Amazon's largest stockholders are Vanguard, Blackrock & State Street!.
* Analysis: This section shows lots of analysis information on the stock. One of the really interesting areas is at the top of the page showing the number of registered analysts for that stock (These are people in Investment banks that are paid to forecast how the stock will do in the future). It shows their average viewpoint of what the stock show be worth and lots of other information.&#x20;

### &#x20;Kavout

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>front page of kavout</p></figcaption></figure>

Kavout is an investment platform that uses artificial intelligence to provide investment insights. I will list some features that make Kavout an effective investment platform:

1. Artificial intelligence algorithms: Kavout's AI algorithms are designed to analyze large datasets and provide investment insights for users. These algorithms can detect patterns and correlations in the data that humans may miss, allowing for more accurate predictions if the AI is trained right, which in this case isn't a problem.
2. Great user interface: Kavout's website seems to be designed to be user-friendly, with intuitive navigation and graphs that are very simple to understand. This can make it easier for investors, especially beginners, to understand the data provided by Kavout.
3. Customizable portfolios: Kavout allows users to create customized portfolios based on their goals going into the investment, their risk tolerance and other factors, these are great insights and can make the game of investing a lot easier.
4. Insights: Kavout provides information insights to guide an investor. For example, Kavout gives stock ratings that update daily, they give buy/sell signals and provide risk assessments. These all would be extremely useful when deciding what stock to buy and saves a lot of time for the user.
5. Community features: Kavout's platform has community features like chat rooms and forums, allowing investors to share ideas and insights with other users. This can be very useful if one has questions to ask or wants to build connections making this an even more valuable platform for a consumer.
6. Backtesting capabilities: Kavout's platform has backtesting capabilities, which allow users to test their investment strategies against historical data allowing the user to evaluate the strategy's performance. This would not give extremely accurate results but it can give an investor a feel of what could happen in certain circumstances.

Overall Kavout is well done and using all these tools would help to make make an investor more effective.
