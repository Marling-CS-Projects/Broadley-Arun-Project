# 1.3 Research

##

My main problems with this project and how to possibly solve them:

1. Acquiring needed skills and knowledge: I  lack the required expertise in finance, artificial intelligence, and machine learning at this moment to do this project successfully. I am going to need to dedicate a lot of time to learning relevant information and analyzing existing research and models.
2. Access to quality data:  Obtaining historical data of for example past stock prices aren't always public stopping me from using them. I will have to limit myself to investigating open-source  data sources.
3. Finding and being accurate with reasons of changes in market: Numerous factors influence financial markets, resulting in constantly changing and messy data. The newsfeeds I will use won't always contain the reasons for a change in stock price. This problem doesnt really have a practical fix but isnt so much a problem. The AI should still beable to predict better then an average human and can be used as a guide. So my AI wont be perfect but it will be helpful.
4. Avoiding overfitting: Issue: AI models can suffer from overfitting, where they perform well on training data but poorly on new data. Remedy: Apply regularization methods, cross-validation, and simpler models to prevent overfitting. Continuously monitor the model's performance on a validation dataset to ensure adaptability.
5. Ensuring model transparency: Issue: AI models, especially deep learning ones, can be hard to understand and interpret. Remedy: Utilize more transparent models or adopt explainable AI techniques to comprehend the model's decision-making process and enhance its transparency.
6. Accounting for unforeseeable market events: Issue: Financial markets can be impacted by unexpected events (e.g., political shifts, natural disasters) that are challenging for AI models to predict. Remedy: Integrate external data sources, like news or social media sentiment, and use models capable of handling uncertainty, such as Bayesian models or reinforcement learning.
7. Ethical considerations: Issue: Using AI models to predict stock market trends can raise ethical concerns, like market manipulation or insider trading. Remedy: Be mindful of these issues and adhere to ethical guidelines and legal regulations when researching and applying AI models in finance.

By combining the enhancement of technical expertise, refining the AI model, utilizing suitable data sources, and maintaining an ethical approach, these challenges can be addressed. Collaborating with experienced professionals and committing to ongoing learning will also contribute to the model's performance and reliability.
