## Competitors - Other websites that do this sort of thing

There are many websites that allow users to look at Stock Market information and do analysis on it. Many of the big ones are the platform ones where their clients buy and sell stocks, Hargreaves Landsowne, YouInvest (AJ Bell), Barclays etc. I don't really have access to those so I've looked at some of the more publicly accessible ones below. &#x20;

I could find lots of information about the history of stock movements. I didn't find many websites that did future predictions. At this stage I'm not sure if thats because they don't exist or I've just not found them.

### www.fool.co.uk

This is a website with a number of journalists that talk about stock trading, why company's share prices should go up or down. It has lots of key data about stocks and shares in the UK.&#x20;

**Historical info on:**

* Share Price Quotes
* Volume
* Dividends
* New-feeds
* Discussion groups in east stock.

### uk.finance.yahoo.com

Seems very similar to the fool website with even more data!

* Share Price Quotes
* Volume
* Dividends
* Financials
* The analysis section shows Analysts' predictions on whether the stock will go up or down. Not sure who those analysts are though.
* Lots of statistics.

### lse.co.uk

The actual London stock exchange website is run by the company that runs the London stock exchange. It shows lots of data on the stocks in the London stock exchange.&#x20;

* Share Price Quotes
* Volume
* Dividends
* Financials

### **Market Data**&#x20;

My main problems with this project and how to possibly solve them:

1. Acquiring needed skills and knowledge: I lack the required knowledge in finance, artificial intelligence, and creation of a user interface at this moment to do this project successfully. I am going to need to dedicate a lot of time to learning relevant information and analyzing existing research and models.
2. Access to quality data:  Obtaining historical data of for example past stock prices aren't always public stopping me from using them. I will have to limit myself to investigating open-source  data sources.
3. Finding and being accurate with reasons of changes in market: Numerous factors influence financial markets, resulting in constantly changing and messy data. The newsfeeds I will use won't always contain the reasons for a change in stock price. This problem doesnt really have a practical fix but isnt so much a problem. The AI should still beable to predict better then an average human and can be used as a guide. So my AI wont be perfect but it will be helpful.
4. Accounting for unforeseeable market events: Financial markets can be impacted by unexpected events like natural disasters or extreme political changes that are borderline impossible for AI models to predict.  I need to also use external data sources for example or social media posts explaining these changes and use models capable of handling uncertainty, such as Bayesian models or reinforcement learning.
5. Ethical considerations:  Using AI models to predict stock market trends can raise ethical concerns, like market manipulation or insider trading.  I need to be mindful of these issues and adhere to ethical guidelines and legal regulations when researching and applying AI models in finance.

By combining the enhancement of technical expertise, refining the AI model, utilizing suitable data sources, and maintaining an ethical approach, these challenges can be addressed. Collaborating with experienced professionals and committing to ongoing learning will also contribute to the model's performance and reliability.
