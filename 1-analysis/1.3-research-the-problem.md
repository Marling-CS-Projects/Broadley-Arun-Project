## Competitors - Other websites that do this sort of thing

There are many websites that allow users to look at Stock Market information and do analysis on it. Many of the big ones are the platform ones where their clients buy and sell stocks, Hargreaves Landsowne, YouInvest (AJ Bell), Barclays, etc. I don't really have access to those so I've looked at some of the more publicly accessible ones below. &#x20;



In summary: I could find lots of information about the history of stock movements. I didn't find many websites that did future predictions.

I've looked in more detail at a few websites below:

### Motley fool - www.fool.co.uk

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Motley fool - Stock View</p></figcaption></figure>

This is a website with a number of journalists that talk about stock trading, and why companies' share prices should go up or down. It has lots of key data about stocks and shares in the UK. This website is a lot more informative for beginners than others with whole sections teaching people how to start investing and trying to guide new investors in the right direction.&#x20;

Website has lots of adverts for its own services, I guess this is how the site is paid for. This makes quite a lot of the really interesting information hidden

**Historical info on:**

* Share Price: This shows graphs of the share price for specific periods for instance last 5 years etc.
* Volume - The website shows the history of volume, which is the number of shares bought on a specific day.
* Dividends - This shows each of the historical dividend payments for this stock. What amount the shareholder got per share and on what day it was announced and then paid.
* Articles - Websites have lots of blogs that will recommend (or not) a stock. These have lots and lots of detail and analysis on the stock. These are written by their journalists.&#x20;
* New feeds - market news feeds that show other articles or regulatory information about the company. Regulatory information is new that a company must stock. There are lots of these.&#x20;
* Discussion groups in each stock. Each stock has a page where users of the website can enter a comment or note on that stock. Sometimes the notes can be quite detailed and interesting. Sometimes they are just 'This stock is rubbish'.

### Yahoo Finance - [https://uk.finance.yahoo.com](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/?guccounter=1\&guce\_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8\&guce\_referrer\_sig=AQAAAJ\_EYCXolXW-t\_F8RkWXykU8FUHEEI1J-UQtkuPq1aKatDZfEsnZe7joMGE72xZz8TCYQMHmHkaRxfqFTspTxsieegdu43zXGMtUExG1KOKsvvva0dgp8bss\_ofSTxZb9Zbac5qw72zMS4vGHlgBW9RywTwgixq7O8i8iDD-0Lv6)

Yahoo finance has lots of information about not just stocks but about other financial instruments, for instance , Currency Trading, Crypto, Funds etc. Seems to cover a much larger footprint than MotleyFool does. It also seems to have little self generated content, hardly any articles etc. Its News section seems to contain lots of articles written by other websites or organisations.

Website also has lots and lots of advertisments making it quite difficult to use.



Seems very similar to the fool website with even more data!

* Share Price: This shows graphs of the share price for specific periods for instance last 5 years etc.
* Volume - The website shows the history of volume, which is the number of shares bought on a specific day.
* Dividends - This shows each of the historical dividend payments for this stock. What amount the shareholder got per share and on what day it was announced and then paid.
* Articles - Websites have lots of blogs that will recommend (or not) a stock. These have lots and lots of detail and analysis on the stock. These are written by their journalists.&#x20;
* New feeds - market news feeds that show other articles or regulatory information about the company. Regulatory information is new that a company must stock. There are lots of these.&#x20;
* Conversations - groups in each stock. Each stock has a page where users of the website can enter a comment or note on that stock. Sometimes the notes can be quite detailed and interesting. Sometimes they are just 'This stock is rubbish'.
